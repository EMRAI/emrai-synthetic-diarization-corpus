2033-164916.4294-32859.2414-165385 ! SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DANDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS ! THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLUTTERING COXCOMB BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY ! WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY ! KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAU AL MAKAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN ! IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED ! WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFEL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE ! THE STORY OF FRIDOLIN AND RETZCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES ! THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS SENTENCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMICK WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU ! SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY !
2414-128292.7018-75789.5442-41169 ! WHITHER HATH MY LONESOMENESS GONE SPAKE HE ! WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT ! LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION ! THEN SIGHING FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND COMORIN ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIPS STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED ! MY SHADOW CALLETH ME ! HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM ! WHAT MATTER ABOUT MY SHADOW ! LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS O NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE ! HE'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD ! LET IT RUN AFTER ME I RUN AWAY FROM IT ! I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT ! THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA TO HIS HEART AND RAN AWAY ! THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD ! VERILY MY FOLLY HATH GROWN BIG IN THE MOUNTAINS ! I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL ! SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE ! NOW DO I HEAR SIX OLD FOOLS LEGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER ! AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT AND MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH ! LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S ! BUT DOTH ZARATHUSTRA NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED BY HIS SHADOW ! OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE ! WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS ! WHY WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND ! ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONGER LEGS THAN MINE ! BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER ! FOR WHEN ZARATHUSTRA SCRUTINISED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID THIS FOLLOWER APPEAR ! THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL ! WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER ! ASKED ZARATHUSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOEST THOU HERE ! THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS ! O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE ! AND WHY CALLEST THOU THYSELF MY SHADOW ! IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT ! I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT ! AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS ! THOU ART NOT PLEASING UNTO ME ! WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT ! THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SORT BUT WE'RE THE LANDOWNERS ! MUST I EVER BE ON THE WAY ! SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES ! O EARTH THOU HAST BECOME TOO ROUND FOR ME ! SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT ! WHEN THE DEVIL CASTETH HIS SKIN DOTH NOT HIS NAME ALSO FALL AWAY IT IS ALSO SKIN ! SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND ! THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY ! THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS SKIN ! QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY ! SOMETIMES I MEANT TO LIE AND BEHOLD ! IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU'VE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWERBEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE ! BY ALLAH O MY LORD ANSWERED I THOU HAST INDEED OVERWHELMED ME WITH THY FAVOURS AND WELL DOINGS BUT I WEARY FOR A SIGHT OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NATIVE COUNTRY ! WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND DOING ! THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID ! BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING ! HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER ! THEN ONLY DID I HIT THE TRUTH ! FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT ! HOW HAVE I STILL INCLINATION ! HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST EYE WITNESSED ! HAVE I STILL A GOAL ! PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED ! OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ! A HAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAIL IS SET ! SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH ! AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT ! FOR IT DO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT HAVE NOT FOUND IT ! I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX ! SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT ! WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT ! O ETERNAL EVERYWHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL IN VAIN ! WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSILIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED ! SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT ! TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE ! THOU ART MY SHADOW ! HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK ! THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN ! SAID HE AT LAST SADLY ! YOU'RE MARRIED I'VE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER ! KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS ! THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WANDERER ! SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS ! YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON ! BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLOMB TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD ! THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES ! THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY ! WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PARKS FOR TIMBER ! BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION ! THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ AWHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT WHOSO COMETH HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE ! FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE ! SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM ! A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE THAN WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS ! THOU HAST LOST THY GOAL ! THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHTN'T TO DO ! THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY ! THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN ! WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA ! WILT THOU HAVE A REST AND A HOME THIS EVENING !

SEEMED IN GOOD SPIRITS LAST NIGHT MISTER GURR EH ! MY POOR LADY VAVASOUR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT !

3528-168669.5764-299665.1688-142285 ! THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR ! THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON ! WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY ! AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST ! MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY ! WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF ! YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY ! WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED ! I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID ! FATHER FAUVENT ! WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR ! REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL ! HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL ! WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE ! AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES ! ARE THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR ! YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE ! IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED ! I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN ! IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED ! I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID ! IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE ! THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED HEAVY ! DID THIS GOD ALLOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS ! HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ! DID HE ALLOW TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS ! THE SLAB OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR ! CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS ! THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES ! WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE ! IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT ! HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DEVOUR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH ! A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN ! HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE ! BECAUSE DOM MABILLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSTIUS ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLONUS HORSTIUS NEITHER DO I ! HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE ! ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH ! DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE ! MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCK YARD ! NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY ! AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH ! AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT ! AND CAN YOU GET A LEVER ! FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE ! SO THEY LEFT MILTON ! THERE IS A RING IN THE STONE ! HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER ! I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT ! OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH ! THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT ! WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY ! FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP ! AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH ! LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM ! NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT ! WILL THAT BE ALL NO ! CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN ! IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS ! CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER ! MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED ! GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MOTHER ! DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE ! JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE ! FAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU ! HOWEVER OUT IT CAME ! I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ! PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL ! AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES REVEREND MOTHER ! WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS ! WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN ! AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING ! OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACES TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR ! BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVEREND MOTHER ! MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL ! PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL ! FATHER FAUVENT REVEREND MOTHER ! I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND ! IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER ! BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD ! YOU KNOW THAT A MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING ! WHAT IS THIS POWER ! THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE ! MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE ! NO DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELL ! SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY ! NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY ! A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES ! AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING ! HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD ! ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING ! IT WAS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION ! BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH ! A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND ! SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER ! THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON ! A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE ! IT IS A RESULT ! THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH ! VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS ! IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC ! ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER ! WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS ! THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW ! WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU ! THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED ! BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ! A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN ! NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING ! HEY MORE OFTEN ! I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O'NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BEULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE ! WHAT DO YOU SAY ! MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD ! I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT ! BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK ! REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN ! AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE ! BUT I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN ! BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE ! THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL ! BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED ! THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OR THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS ! NOUGHT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON ! THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAS SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE ! AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK ! BUT WHAT WAS IT ! AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRIORESS ! AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED ! IT CUT MORE OFTEN SHORT ! YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON ! FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD ! THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED ! I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY ! IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL ! A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER ! I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW ! FATHER FAUVENT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION ! THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE ! THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE ! MAN JUDGES HIMSELF ! SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT ! AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT OF A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID ! IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL ! SHE GAVE US HER LAST COMMANDS ! YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST ! MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF ! IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER CELL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED ! BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED ! THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH ! GASPED BESSY AT LAST ! HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOOD ! FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING ! WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER ! FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON ! WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA ! I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT ! COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION ! BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES ! COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY ! MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN ! WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM ! REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS ! THEY HATED PLEASURE ! NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO ! THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS ! BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE ! FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT ! THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE ! SHE CONTINUED FATHER FAUVENT ! I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE ! YES REVEREND MOTHER ! THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN ! SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE ! I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL ! THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED ! BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT ! LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS ! THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED SO BE IT ! THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN ! IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK ! FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND MOTHER ! BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET ! FATHER FAUVENT MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN WHICH SHE HAS SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS JUST ! IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT ! IT IS A CONTINUATION OF HER SLUMBER ! HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL ! SO I SHALL HAVE TO NAIL UP THAT COFFIN YES ! DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS ! I AM AT THE ORDERS OF THE VERY REVEREND COMMUNITY ! RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAS FAILED ! THE FOUR MOTHER PRECENTORS WILL ASSIST YOU ! I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WI SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE ! NO IN LOWERING THE COFFIN ! RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT ! WHERE INTO THE VAULT ! RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MAN FREE ! FAUCHELEVENT STARTED THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR ! THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE ! UNDER THE ALTAR BUT ! IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST ! BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART ! YOU WILL HAVE AN IRON BAR YES BUT ! SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE ! ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES ! YOU WILL RAISE THE STONE WITH THE BAR BY MEANS OF THE RING BUT ! CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION ! MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM ! CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ALMS ! THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION ! RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE ! SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US ! PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID ! WE MUST HAVE CORNER STONES ! BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN ! THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENT ! I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YO'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YO WILL BUT JUST SAY IT ! OH I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS ! IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM ! THINK FATHER FAUVENT IF SHE WERE TO WORK MIRACLES HERE ! I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES ! WHAT A GLORY OF GOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MIRACLES ISSUE FROM TOMBS ! I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET ! BUT REVEREND MOTHER IF THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY COMMISSION ! MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL ! BUT THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE ! THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED ! SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME ! IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED ! HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR ! IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR ! NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE ! CHONODEMAIRE ONE OF THE SEVEN GERMAN KINGS WHO ENTERED AMONG THE GAULS UNDER THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTIUS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF NUNS TO BE BURIED IN RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY BENEATH THE ALTAR ! IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE ! SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE ! THE WORLD IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROSS ! EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY ! MARTIN THE ELEVENTH GENERAL OF THE CARTHUSIANS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE STAT CRUX DUM VOLVITUR ORBIS ! I SAY WHAT I THINK ! THE PRIORESS WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVERFULL ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY ! EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS ! I HAVE ON MY RIGHT BENOIT AND ON MY LEFT BERNARD WHO WAS BERNARD ! THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT ! I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL ! IN THE INFINITE CHAIN THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK ! WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT ! WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS ! THE FIRST ABBOT OF CLAIRVAUX ! WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS ! WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED ! VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE MOTHER ! WE KNOW THE PATHS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED ! THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET ! WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED ! HIS ORDER HAS PRODUCED FORTY POPES TWO HUNDRED CARDINALS FIFTY PATRIARCHS SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARCHBISHOPS FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BISHOPS FOUR EMPERORS TWELVE EMPRESSES FORTY SIX KINGS FORTY ONE QUEENS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CANONIZED SAINTS AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS ! FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD ! ON ONE SIDE SAINT BERNARD ON THE OTHER THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY DEPARTMENT ! MISSUS THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY ! WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAILED ! GOD SUBORDINATED TO THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE SUCH IS THE AGE SILENCE FAUVENT ! THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY ! NO ONE DOUBTS THE RIGHT OF THE MONASTERY TO SEPULTURE ! I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED ! ONLY FANATICS AND THOSE IN ERROR DENY IT ! PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE ! THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN ! WE LIVE IN TIMES OF TERRIBLE CONFUSION ! SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY ! WE ARE IGNORANT AND IMPIOUS ! MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA ! AND THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED WHY ! FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY ! I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT ! NATURE PRODUCES WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT ! BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGITTAIRE BISHOP OF GAP WAS THE BROTHER OF SALONE BISHOP OF EMBRUN AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MOMMOL ! TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT ! MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION ! THEY PERSECUTE THE SAINTS ! WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BURDENS AND CURSES WHY ! THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH DARKNESS IS THE RULE ! I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO ! THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEASTS ARE BEASTS WHICH ARE BLIND ! THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER ! PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF !
3538-163619.2609-157645.6128-63241 ! THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE ! EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT ! FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD ! POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT ! THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGULATION QUOTED OF SMOKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN ! BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE ! SOMETIMES TOBACCO WAS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTING OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES ! THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER ! KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD ! RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL ! WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL ! HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC ! THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE ! BLACKBURN ARCHBISHOP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER ! SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY ! AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND ! HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT ! WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA ! THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART ! ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION ! IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES ! ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DISNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON ! WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN ! PARR WAS SUCH A CONTINUAL SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HAD NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE ! ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH ! ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITCHFIELD HE HAD AN EXTRA PIPE AND JOSHUA THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING IMPATIENT ! IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN ! SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT ! OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID ! OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT ! LET THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE ! SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL ! THEY HAVE SIR REPLIED THE CLERK ! SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON ! THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE ! HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED ! SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO POUCHES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE ! I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE ! OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASIL RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND ! THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN !
3538-163624.3005-163391.2414-128291 ! ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD ! WHICH WAS SOUND ENOUGH JUDGMENT BUT YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE MAN AND HE WOULDN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO HOWL ! WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME ! THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED ! THE KING'S DUDS WAS ALL BLACK AND HE DID LOOK REAL SWELL AND STARCHY ! HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ! WHY BEFORE HE LOOKED LIKE THE ORNERIEST OLD RIP THAT EVER WAS BUT NOW WHEN HE'D TAKE OFF HIS NEW WHITE BEAVER AND MAKE A BOW AND DO A SMILE HE LOOKED THAT GRAND AND GOOD AND PIOUS THAT YOU'D SAY HE HAD WALKED RIGHT OUT OF THE ARK AND MAYBE WAS OLD LEVITICUS HIMSELF ! BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED ! WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE KINE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER ! JIM CLEANED UP THE CANOE AND I GOT MY PADDLE READY ! WHAT DO I HERE SEEK ! SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID ! ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKEST THOU MISCHIEF MAKER THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON EARTH ! THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS ! FOR I TELL THEE THAT I HAVE ALREADY TALKED HALF A MORNING UNTO THEM AND JUST NOW WERE THEY ABOUT TO GIVE ME THEIR ANSWER ! WHER YOU BOUND FOR YOUNG MAN ! HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM ! GIT ABOARD SAYS THE KING ! HE WOULD NOT BE RID OF HIS AFFLICTION ! I DONE SO AND THEN WE ALL THREE STARTED ON AGAIN ! WHO HATH NOT AT PRESENT HIS HEART HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYES FULL OF DISGUST ! THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM ! THE YOUNG CHAP WAS MIGHTY THANKFUL SAID IT WAS TOUGH WORK TOTING HIS BAGGAGE SUCH WEATHER ! THOU ALSO THOU ALSO ! ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM ! BUT BEHOLD THESE KINE ! SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE ! THE KINE HOWEVER GAZED AT IT ALL AND WONDERED ! THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGIN ! HE ASKED THE KING WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THE KING TOLD HIM HE'D COME DOWN THE RIVER AND LANDED AT THE OTHER VILLAGE THIS MORNING AND NOW HE WAS GOING UP A FEW MILE TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND ON A FARM UP THERE THE YOUNG FELLOW SAYS ! SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO ! WANTON AVIDITY BILIOUS ENVY CAREWORN REVENGE POPULACE PRIDE ALL THESE STRUCK MINE EYE !

NO MY NAME'S BLODGETT ELEXANDER BLODGETT REVEREND ELEXANDER BLODGETT I S'POSE I MUST SAY AS I'M ONE O THE LORD'S POOR SERVANTS ! THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY ! YOU SEE HE WAS PRETTY OLD AND GEORGE'S G'YIRLS WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE MUCH COMPANY FOR HIM EXCEPT MARY JANE THE RED HEADED ONE AND SO HE WAS KINDER LONESOME AFTER GEORGE AND HIS WIFE DIED AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH TO LIVE ! BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART ! THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HOWEVER IS WITH THE KINE AND WHY IS IT NOT WITH THE RICH ! TOO BAD TOO BAD HE COULDN'T A LIVED TO SEE HIS BROTHERS POOR SOUL ! SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE ! I'M GOING IN A SHIP NEXT WEDNESDAY FOR RYO JANEERO WHERE MY UNCLE LIVES ! WHY DOST THOU TEMPT ME !

SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED ! BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT !
4198-12259.7105-2330.1998-29455 ! DRAW REACH FILL MIX GIVE IT ME WITHOUT WATER ! UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBAFF'S GUILT ! SO MY FRIEND SO WHIP ME OFF THIS GLASS NEATLY BRING ME HITHER SOME CLARET A FULL WEEPING GLASS TILL IT RUN OVER ! HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER ! THE SINGING AND LAUGHING WENT ON LONG AFTER HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND IF LATER IN THE EVENING THERE WERE LOUD VOICED ARGUMENTS OR QUARRELS EVEN DICKIE DID NOT HEAR THEM ! THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL ! WHAT'S ALL THAT THERE DICKIE ASKED POINTING TO THE ODD KNOBBLY BUNDLES OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES TIED ON TO THE PERAMBULATOR'S FRONT ! A CESSATION AND TRUCE WITH THIRST ! OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE ! TELL YER WHAT MATE LOOKS TO ME AS IF I'D TOOK A FANCY TO YOU ! YOU HAVE CATCHED A COLD GAMMER YEA FORSOOTH SIR ! SWELP ME HE SAID HELPLESSLY ! A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE ! BY THE BELLY OF SANCT BUFF LET US TALK OF OUR DRINK I NEVER DRINK BUT AT MY HOURS LIKE THE POPE'S MULE ! HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES ! OH LOOK SAID DICKIE THE FLOWERS ! THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH ! WHICH WAS FIRST THIRST OR DRINKING ! THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE ! THEY'RE ONLY WEEDS SAID BEALE ! WHAT IT SEEMS I DO NOT DRINK BUT BY AN ATTORNEY ! THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL ! BUT I SHALL HAVE THEM WHILE THEY'RE ALIVE SAID DICKIE AS HE HAD SAID TO THE PAWNBROKER ABOUT THE MOONFLOWERS ! THE JURY WISH TO ADD A RIDER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND ! DRINK ALWAYS AND YOU SHALL NEVER DIE ! HI THERE GOES A RABBIT ! AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY ! IF I DRINK NOT I AM A GROUND DRY GRAVELLED AND SPENT I AM STARK DEAD WITHOUT DRINK AND MY SOUL READY TO FLY INTO SOME MARSH AMONGST FROGS THE SOUL NEVER DWELLS IN A DRY PLACE DROUTH KILLS IT ! FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF ! HE DRINKS IN VAIN THAT FEELS NOT THE PLEASURE OF IT ! OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN ! SEE IM CROST THE ROAD THERE SEE HIM ! SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY ! IT IS ENOUGH TO BREAK BOTH GIRDS AND PETREL ! HOW BEAUTIFUL SAID DICKIE WRIGGLING WITH DELIGHT ! WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN A BOTTLE AND A FLAGON ! THIS LIFE OF THE RABBIT AS DESCRIBED BY MISTER BEALE WAS THE CHILD'S FIRST GLIMPSE OF FREEDOM I'D LIKE TO BE A RABBIT ! BRAVELY AND WELL PLAYED UPON THE WORDS ! NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTERBAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS ! OW'M I TO WHEEL THE BLOOMIN PRAM IF YOU GOES ON LIKE AS IF YOU WAS A BAG OF EELS ! HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RADPROP IS IN TO NIGHT ! I LIKE YOU NEXTER MY OWN DADDY AND MISTER BAXTER NEXT DOOR ! DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRELAWNEY REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT ! OUR FATHERS DRANK LUSTILY AND EMPTIED THEIR CANS ! THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID MISTER BEALE AWKWARDLY ! WELL CACKED WELL SUNG ! HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO ! DICKIE QUICK TO IMITATE TOUCHED HIS ! COME LET US DRINK WILL YOU SEND NOTHING TO THE RIVER ! POOR LITTLE MAN SAID THE LADY YOU MISS YOUR MOTHER DON'T YOU ! I DRINK NO MORE THAN A SPONGE ! OH WELL DONE LITTLE UN SAID MISTER BEALE TO HIMSELF ! I DRINK LIKE A TEMPLAR KNIGHT ! THE TWO TRAVELLERS WERE LEFT FACING EACH OTHER THE RICHER BY A PENNY AND OH WONDERFUL GOOD FORTUNE A WHOLE HALF CROWN ! HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW ! NO I NEVER SAID DICKIE ERE'S THE STEEVER ! AND I TANQUAM SPONSUS ! YOU STICK TO THAT SAID BEALE RADIANT WITH DELIGHT YOU'RE A FAIR MASTERPIECE YOU ARE YOU EARNED IT HONEST IF EVER A KID DONE ! SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES ! AND I SICUT TERRA SINE AQUA ! THEY WENT ON UP THE HILL AS HAPPY AS ANY ONE NEED WISH TO BE ! ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND ! PLEASE DO NOT BE TOO SHOCKED ! GIVE ME A SYNONYMON FOR A GAMMON OF BACON ! POLL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES ! REMEMBER THAT NEITHER OF THEM KNEW ANY BETTER ! IS PLATTERBAFF OUT YET ! TO THE ELDER TRAMP LIES AND BEGGING WERE NATURAL MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD ! IT IS THE COMPULSORY OF DRINKERS IT IS A PULLEY ! IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY ! BUT YOU SAID THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS URGED DICKIE ! A LITTLE RAIN ALLAYS A GREAT DEAL OF WIND LONG TIPPLING BREAKS THE THUNDER ! THE CHIEF ORGANISER RANG OFF ! BUT IF THERE CAME SUCH LIQUOR FROM MY BALLOCK WOULD YOU NOT WILLINGLY THEREAFTER SUCK THE UDDER WHENCE IT ISSUED ! WHICH THIS AIN'T NOT BY NO MEANS ! HERE PAGE FILL ! THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE ! I APPEAL FROM THIRST AND DISCLAIM ITS JURISDICTION ! CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANISER ! I WAS WONT HERETOFORE TO DRINK OUT ALL BUT NOW I LEAVE NOTHING ! THE NIGHT IS FULL OF INTERESTING LITTLE SOUNDS THAT WILL NOT AT FIRST LET YOU SLEEP THE RUSTLE OF LITTLE WILD THINGS IN THE HEDGES THE BARKING OF DOGS IN DISTANT FARMS THE CHIRP OF CRICKETS AND THE CROAKING OF FROGS ! I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE ! THE NEW GAME OF BEGGING AND INVENTING STORIES TO INTEREST THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO BEG WENT ON GAILY DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK AND DICKIE BY CONSTANT PRACTICE GREW SO CLEVER AT TAKING HIS PART IN THE ACTING THAT MISTER BEALE WAS QUITE DAZED WITH ADMIRATION ! EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WILL VOTE THE OTHER WAY ! BLESSED IF I EVER SEE SUCH A NIPPER HE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN ! A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN ! CLEVER AS A TRAINDAWG E IS AN ALL OUTER IS OWN EAD ! IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ROOMS AT NEMESIS ! I AIN'T SURE AS I ADN'T BETTER STICK TO THE ROAD AND KEEP AWAY FROM OLD ANDS LIKE YOU JIM ! WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND ! I OPE E'S CLEVER ENOUGH TO DO WOT E'S TOLD KEEP IS MUG SHUT THAT'S ALL ! HEYDAY HERE ARE TRIPES FIT FOR OUR SPORT AND IN EARNEST EXCELLENT GODEBILLIOS OF THE DUN OX YOU KNOW WITH THE BLACK STREAK ! IF E'S STRAIGHT E'LL DO FOR ME AND IF HE AIN'T I'LL DO FOR IM SEE ! O FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US LASH THEM SOUNDLY YET THRIFTILY ! A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST !

HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY ! HO THIS WILL BANG IT SOUNDLY ! IF ANY ONE ARSTS YOU IF YOU EVER SEE IM YOU NEVER SET EYES ON IM IN ALL YOUR BORN NOT TO REMEMBER IM ! BUT THIS SHALL BANISH IT UTTERLY ! DICKIE WAS FULL OF QUESTIONS BUT MISTER BEALE HAD NO ANSWERS FOR THEM ! LET US WIND OUR HORNS BY THE SOUND OF FLAGONS AND BOTTLES AND CRY ALOUD THAT WHOEVER HATH LOST HIS THIRST COME NOT HITHER TO SEEK IT ! DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANISER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS ! THE GREAT GOD MADE THE PLANETS AND WE MAKE THE PLATTERS NEAT ! THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES ! APPETITE COMES WITH EATING SAYS ANGESTON BUT THE THIRST GOES AWAY WITH DRINKING ! LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER ! NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER BEALE'S RULE OF LIFE ! THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION ! THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON A DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME UPON GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GRAY ! I HAVE A REMEDY AGAINST THIRST QUITE CONTRARY TO THAT WHICH IS GOOD AGAINST THE BITING OF A MAD DOG ! IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM ! WHITE WINE HERE WINE BOYS ! THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL ! O LACHRYMA CHRISTI IT IS OF THE BEST GRAPE ! WHAT'S THAT THERE SAID DICKIE ! I'FAITH PURE GREEK GREEK O THE FINE WHITE WINE !
4852-28311.3538-142836.3080-5032 ! SAY YOU KNOW SUMTHIN ! BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY ! CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG ! GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES ! I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER ! THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN ! HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY ! KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB BAD THAT'S JAKEY HARRIS ! FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES ! O K HE SAID ! WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A GARLAND ! ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF ! BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE ! MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET ! WELL THE BEST ON'T IS I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT ! IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD ! IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST ! LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN ! WELL HE ADMITTED I DID ! ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THREE S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE ! IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL ! CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE ! MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS ! BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE ! TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT ! THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED ! MISTER FISH IS THE SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND A SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN ! FOURTEEN NINETY NINE ! I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM ! HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON ! BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE ! I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUTS THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE ! MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED ! BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE ! BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM ! I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME ! THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE ! MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER ! FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED ! AW SHUCKS ! THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED ! CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE ! IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED ! BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS ! AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS ! MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST ! THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE ! MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR ! I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM ! THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE ! A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE ! YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS ! IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY ! THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB ! CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT ! ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF ! IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE ! AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE ! IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SCAPE IT ! THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES ! WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS ! THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME ! ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN ! HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS ! BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE ! THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS ! THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN'T UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS ! ICES ! IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT ! AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH ! HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD ! THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN ! HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT ! I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER ! HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL ! THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION ! WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY !
4852-28312.3997-180297.3005-163390 ! OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP ! ANDBUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JUST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY ! I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS ! THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME ! SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM ! TWENTY PEOPLE SINGS OUT ! WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER ! YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW ! HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER ! THE DUKE SAYS YES ! WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE ! MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE ! EVERYBODY SINGS OUT SOLD ! DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY ! THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD ! BUT A BIG FINE LOOKING MAN JUMPS UP ON A BENCH AND SHOUTS HOLD ON ! LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES ! MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ! CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE ! YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO ! JUST A WORD GENTLEMEN THEY STOPPED TO LISTEN ! CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM ! WHAT WE WANT IS TO GO OUT OF HERE QUIET AND TALK THIS SHOW UP AND SELL THE REST OF THE TOWN ! YES SIR HE SAID ! YOU BET IT IS THE JEDGE IS RIGHT EVERYBODY SINGS OUT ! I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB ! BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM ! HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE ! WE STRUCK THE RAFT AT THE SAME TIME AND IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS WE WAS GLIDING DOWN STREAM ALL DARK AND STILL AND EDGING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NOBODY SAYING A WORD ! IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON ! JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB ! WE NEVER SHOWED A LIGHT TILL WE WAS ABOUT TEN MILE BELOW THE VILLAGE ! I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN ! GREENHORNS FLATHEADS ! IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW ! WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES ! HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL ! HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND ! NO I SAYS IT DON'T ! I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS ! WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR ! WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS ! WELL IT DON'T BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BREED I RECKON THEY'RE ALL ALIKE ! BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS ! I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION ! WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M A SAYING ALL KINGS IS MOSTLY RAPSCALLIONS AS FUR AS I CAN MAKE OUT IS DAT SO ! WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAS INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER ! THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL ! TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES ! AND LOOK AT CHARLES SECOND AND LOUIS FOURTEEN AND LOUIS FIFTEEN AND JAMES SECOND AND EDWARD SECOND AND RICHARD THIRD AND FORTY MORE BESIDES ALL THEM SAXON HEPTARCHIES THAT USED TO RIP AROUND SO IN OLD TIMES AND RAISE CAIN ! WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT ! MY YOU OUGHT TO SEEN OLD HENRY THE EIGHT WHEN HE WAS IN BLOOM HE WAS A BLOSSOM ! WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES ! RING UP FAIR ROSAMUN ! WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM ! WELL HENRY HE TAKES A NOTION HE WANTS TO GET UP SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS COUNTRY ! NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE ! THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT ! IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE ! S'POSE HE OPENED HIS MOUTHWHAT THEN ! THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER ! ALL I SAY IS KINGS IS KINGS AND YOU GOT TO MAKE ALLOWANCES ! ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY ! SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES ! IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN ! TAKE THEM ALL AROUND THEY'RE A MIGHTY ORNERY LOT IT'S THE WAY THEY'RE RAISED ! I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ! WELL THEY ALL DO JIM ! WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE ! THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE ! MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES ! NOW DE DUKE HE'S A TOLERBLE LIKELY MAN IN SOME WAYS ! FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION ! THIS ONE'S A MIDDLING HARD LOT FOR A DUKE ! NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS ! MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME ! WHEN I WAKED UP JUST AT DAYBREAK HE WAS SITTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWIXT HIS KNEES MOANING AND MOURNING TO HIMSELF ! WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN ! IT DON'T SEEM NATURAL BUT I RECKON IT'S SO ! MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID ! HE WAS OFTEN MOANING AND MOURNING THAT WAY NIGHTS WHEN HE JUDGED I WAS ASLEEP AND SAYING PO LITTLE LIZABETH ! A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST ! DOAN YOU HEAR ME SHET DE DO ! HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK ! I LAY I MAKE YOU MINE ! THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD ! I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME ! JIS AS LOUD AS I COULD YELL ! A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD !
4852-28319.1998-15444.4294-35475 ! THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY ! BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG ! IF CALLED TO A CASE SUPPOSED OR SUSPECTED TO BE ONE OF POISONING THE MEDICAL MAN HAS TWO DUTIES TO PERFORM TO SAVE THE PATIENT'S LIFE AND TO PLACE HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO GIVE EVIDENCE IF CALLED ON TO DO SO ! THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN ! HE SHOULD MAKE INQUIRIES AS TO SYMPTOMS AND TIME AT WHICH FOOD OR MEDICINE WAS LAST TAKEN ! BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH ! HE SHOULD NOTICE THE POSITION AND TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY THE CONDITION OF RIGOR MORTIS MARKS OF VIOLENCE APPEARANCE OF LIPS AND MOUTH ! HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT ! IN MAKING A POST MORTEM EXAMINATION THE ALIMENTARY CANAL SHOULD BE REMOVED AND PRESERVED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION ! IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM ! CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK ! THE GUT AND THE GULLET BEING CUT ACROSS BETWEEN THESE LIGATURES THE STOMACH MAY BE REMOVED ENTIRE WITHOUT SPILLING ITS CONTENTS ! ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN ! FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING ! WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST ! IF THE MEDICAL PRACTITIONER IS IN DOUBT ON ANY POINT HE SHOULD OBTAIN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS PAID ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT ! I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE ! HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY ! ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES ! SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK ! THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE ! MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE ! IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT ! IN A CASE OF ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY POISONING IS IT THE DUTY OF THE DOCTOR TO INFORM THE POLICE ! AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN ! THE BEST EMETIC IS THAT WHICH IS AT HAND ! THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE ! SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT ! THE DOSE FOR AN ADULT IS TEN MINIMS ! THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER ! APOMORPHINE IS NOT ALLIED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION TO MORPHINE AND MAY BE GIVEN IN CASES OF NARCOTIC POISONING ! HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTON ! TICKLING THE FAUCES WITH A FEATHER MAY EXCITE VOMITING ! THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM ! HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS ! IN USING THE ELASTIC STOMACH TUBE SOME FLUID SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO THE STOMACH BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EMPTY IT OR A PORTION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE MAY BE SUCKED INTO THE APERTURE ! HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY ! THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE ! THE TUBE SHOULD BE EXAMINED TO SEE THAT IT IS NOT BROKEN OR CRACKED AS ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED FROM NEGLECTING THIS PRECAUTION ! SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN ! HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM ! THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES ! ANTIDOTES ARE USUALLY GIVEN HYPODERMICALLY OR IF BY MOUTH IN THE FORM OF TABLETS ! THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS ! A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE ! IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE ! IN THE ABSENCE OF A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE THE REMEDY MAY BE GIVEN BY THE RECTUM ! THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS ! NOTICE THE SMELL COLOUR AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE MATTER SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION ! HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION ! FOR THE SEPARATION OF AN ALKALOID THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROCESS OF STAS OTTO ! AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE ! BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE ! IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING ! CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR ! THIS PROCESS IS BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE SALTS OF THE ALKALOIDS ARE SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND WATER AND INSOLUBLE IN ETHER ! WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY ! THE PURE ALKALOIDS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MORPHINE IN ITS CRYSTALLINE FORM ARE SOLUBLE IN ETHER ! HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM ! TWO COOL THE MIXTURE AND FILTER WASH THE RESIDUE WITH STRONG ALCOHOL AND MIX THE FILTRATES ! WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT ! THE RESIDUE MAY BE SET ASIDE FOR THE DETECTION OF THE METALLIC POISONS IF SUSPECTED EXPEL THE ALCOHOL BY CAREFUL EVAPORATION ! MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE ! THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM ! THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND TO BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS ! DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY ! ON THE EVAPORATION OF THE ALCOHOL THE RESINOUS AND FATTY MATTERS SEPARATE ! CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME ! EVAPORATE THE FILTRATE TO A SYRUP AND EXTRACT WITH SUCCESSIVE PORTIONS OF ABSOLUTE ALCOHOL ! TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE ! SEPARATE THE ETHEREAL SOLUTION AND EVAPORATE ! AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR ! MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED ! BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS ! FIVE A PART OF THIS ETHEREAL SOLUTION IS POURED INTO A WATCH GLASS AND ALLOWED TO EVAPORATE ! WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY ! SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE CISEAUX ! TO PURIFY IT ADD A SMALL QUANTITY OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND AFTER EVAPORATING TO THREE QUARTERS OF ITS BULK ADD A SATURATED SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF POTASH OR SODA !
4852-28330.3331-159609.7902-96591 ! THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST ! I AM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST ! NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM ! DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME ! GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL ! FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS ! AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES ! PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE ! NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN ! IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS ! IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN ! I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE ! THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI ! TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR ! THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAEME HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE ! WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE ! NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE ! HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL ! FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN ! CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN ! PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHY WAS SILENT ! CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING ! I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME ! MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE ! THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT ! THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT ! HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD ! CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE ! HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK ! POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY ! IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD ! NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT ! THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING ! ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF JOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION ! THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO ! COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM ! IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE ! I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH ! THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY ! IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY ! HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM ! I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN ! WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE ! FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING ! THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS ! SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE ! YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR ! NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT ! SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL ! THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD ! BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER ! TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE ! IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS ! CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE ! IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM ! HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS ! SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS ! THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL ! CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD ! NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY ! POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST ! WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS THOUGHT TO ASK ! FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS ! YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY ! I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT ! NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT ! I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU ! SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOZE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE ! FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM ! NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD ! A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES ! BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ ! HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR !
533-1066.3538-163622.2609-169640 ! WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN ! PROAS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY SHIPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEA IS FULL OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE ! WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING ! AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP ! I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD ! FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAST BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS A LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN A LIVELY DANCE ! I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT ! I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SHIP MOST ESPECIALLY IN MODERATE WEATHER ! THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH ! FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVES WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE ! MISTER MARBLE HE I DO BELIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HEN COOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BARELY ASLEEP ! HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING ! OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES ! AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE ONE FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN A BOAT ! MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT ! I SANG OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD ! I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY ! HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE ! I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL ! ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME ! THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT ! YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH ! SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID ! HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN ! PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING ! THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER ! AS OUR SHEETS WERE ALL FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT ! LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY ! I SOON SAW BOTH PROAS AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER ! WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM ! THEY WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED ! COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR ! THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT ! MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK ! THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG ! I ASKED NO QUESTIONS ! SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY ! A BREATHLESS STILLNESS SUCCEEDED ! ON THE THIRD DAY CINDERLAD WANTED TO SET OUT ! ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE ! THE PROAS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST ! THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY ! I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PIKES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS ! I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDERLAD ! KITE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES ! I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED ! I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDERLAD ! THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT ! THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH ! AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY ! THE JOHN BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TOP ! I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT ! WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW ! THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE ! IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY ! THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INSTANT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS ! IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES ! YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDERLAD ! THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED ! NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JOHN WAS HURT ! IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE ! ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERN MOST PROA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT ! THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY ! CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE ! THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISH ! A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BURYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP ! FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US ! I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN ! WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING !
533-131562.8461-278226.4198-12281 ! IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KEYS MY DEAR WHAT KEYS ! AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PET PLANS ! ALTHOUGH THE PLAGUE WAS THERE IN THE MOST PART OF ALL THE HOUSES THEY NEVERTHELESS ENTERED EVERYWHERE THEN PLUNDERED AND CARRIED AWAY ALL THAT WAS WITHIN AND YET FOR ALL THIS NOT ONE OF THEM TOOK ANY HURT WHICH IS A MOST WONDERFUL CASE ! SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JOUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE ! I BESEECH YOU THINK UPON IT ! ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY ! NEVERTHELESS AT ALL ADVENTURES THEY RANG THE BELLS AD CAPITULUM CAPITULANTES ! THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWERS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND ! BY THE VIRTUE OF GOD WHY DO NOT YOU SING PANNIERS FAREWELL VINTAGE IS DONE ! I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY ! THE KEY OF MY DESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT ! BY THE BELLY OF SANCT JAMES WHAT SHALL WE POOR DEVILS DRINK THE WHILE ! I REMEMBER ALL THE RUBENSES AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA ! NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY ! LORD GOD DA MIHI POTUM ! SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES ! AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY ! IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON ! THAT AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY ! BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY ! LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICE ! MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP STAIRS ! PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY ! WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER ! HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY ! HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SANCT ANTHONY BURN ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT IF THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE ! I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING ROOM AT JOCELYN'S ROCK ! TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPONDYLES OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BALAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MOWER ! SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KERSTALL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM ! TO SOME WITH A SMART SOUSE ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFF SWAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOMEPUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT ! MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S THE VERY DEVIL FOR SPITE ! THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE ! I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE ! BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS ! BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW ! I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE ! I SHALL PUT YOU UPON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION ! YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES ! AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREAVES MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UPON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN !
5484-24317.3997-180294.367-130732 ! WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN ! THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE ! BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR ! YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT ! SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR ! WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU ! SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION ! LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS ! THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE ! WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH ! HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER ! THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH ! THERE ARE BOLTS ON THE DOOR WRETCH ! SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM ! I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO ! THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN ! NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN ! THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS ! A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN ! THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING ! IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER ! HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY ! EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSELS OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE ! IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DELMONICO ! WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATEUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED ! THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED ! THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINOE ! LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG ! THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERIOUS VEIL ! ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE HALF PINT OF CREAM YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS ONE WINE GLASS OF SHERRY LOBSTER FAT ! WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS ! PUT THIS IN A DOUBLE BOILER AND LET COOK UNTIL THICK STIRRING CONSTANTLY ! TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM ! SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH THIN SLICES OF DRY TOAST ! THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT ! A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST ! KING OF SHELL FISH ! WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER ! ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELL FISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB ! CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES ! THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE ! I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO ! IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP ! HIS SON HAD BEEN THIS ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE ! IT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY ! THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HERMON INCREDULOUSLY ! GOBEY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE ! WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD ! IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBEY'S OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER ! BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER ! GOBEY'S CRAB STEW ! BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISON ! TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL OF THE FAT FROM THE SHELL ! THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LEECH CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLUS ! SOAK THE CRAB MEAT IN THE SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING ! WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY ! CHOP FINE THE ONION SWEET PEPPER AND TOMATO WITH THE ROSEMARY ! LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE ! HEAT THIS IN A STEWPAN AND WHEN SIMMERING ADD THE SHERRY AND CRAB MEAT AND LET ALL COOK TOGETHER WITH A SLOW FIRE FOR EIGHT MINUTES ! THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM ! SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTED CRACKERS OR THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD ! YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINOE IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT ! LOBSTER IN MINIATURE ! HOW WHY ! SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOF BRAU HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM ! MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT ! ALL OF THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM ! HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE ! HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT ! THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE ! COME DURING THE THIRD ENTR'ACTE ! BISQUE OF CRAWFISH ! THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER ! WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU ! ONLY ONE REMAINED EMPTY THE STAGE BOX ! TAKE THIRTY CRAWFISH FROM WHICH REMOVE THE GUT CONTAINING THE GALL IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TAKE FIRM HOLD OF THE CRAWFISH WITH THE LEFT HAND SO AS TO AVOID BEING PINCHED BY ITS CLAWS WITH THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND PINCH THE EXTREME END OF THE CENTRAL FIN OF THE TAIL AND WITH A SUDDEN JERK THE GUT WILL BE WITHDRAWN ! THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMON ! MINCE OR CUT INTO SMALL DICE A CARROT AN ONION ONE HEAD OF CELERY AND A FEW PARSLEY ROOTS AND TO THESE ADD A BAY LEAF A SPRIG OF THYME A LITTLE MINIONETTE PEPPER AND TWO OUNCES OF BUTTER ! HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES ! PUT THESE INGREDIENTS INTO A STEWPAN AND FRY THEM TEN MINUTES THEN THROW IN THE CRAWFISH AND POUR ON THEM HALF A BOTTLE OF FRENCH WHITE WINE ! AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED ! ALLOW THIS TO BOIL AND THEN ADD A QUART OF STRONG CONSOMME AND LET ALL CONTINUE BOILING FOR HALF AN HOUR ! THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT ! PICK OUT THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ALL THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLES ! DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE ! HERMON LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE ! PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY FIVE OF THE CRAWFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED ! THE RHODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSINOE ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE ! RESERVE SOME OF THE SPAWN ALSO HALF OF THE BODY SHELLS WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE CRAWFISH BUTTER TO FINISH THE SOUP ! YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM ! THIS BUTTER IS MADE AS FOLLOWS PLACE THE SHELLS ON A BAKING SHEET IN THE OVEN TO DRY LET THE SHELLS COOL AND THEN POUND THEM IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOBSTER CORAL AND FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH BUTTER THOROUGHLY BRUISING THE WHOLE TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE A FINE PASTE ! WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD !
5484-24318.2414-159411.4350-10919 ! NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES ! ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMAN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM ! HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER ! TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION ! THE BRAHMAN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME ! BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS ! OH FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT ! THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY ! WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK ! I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN ! WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART ! WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING ! THEN THE BRAHMAN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS ! OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET THIS SUDDEN END AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS ! IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR ! SO THE BRAHMAN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANYAN TREE AND THE BRAHMAN SAID TO IT BANYAN TREE BANYAN TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT ! AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH ! DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED ! ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANYAN TREE ! THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS ! WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE ! AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALNUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON ! THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAHMAN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LET HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME ! IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY ! THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION ! IS IT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO ! BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH ! YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH ! LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE ! THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY ! SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT ! YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM ! BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND ! AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE ! AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS ! IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT ! SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE ! HE ASKED AH IT IS ! LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE ! LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY ! OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES ! CRIED HERMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE ! THREE OUT OF THE SIX HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMAN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE ! TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH ! AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR ! DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPUS SILENCED HER WITH THE GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING ! ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE ! WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT ! THE BRAHMAN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES ! AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART ! THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY ! IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE ! THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID THE JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN ! HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU ! BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES ! AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMAN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT ! AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED ! BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME ! I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS ! AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS ! THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE ! OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR ! NOW THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL ! DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED ! THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT ! BUT HERMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW ! SHOW ME THE PLACE ! THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE ! WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE JACKAL SAID NOW BRAHMAN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD ! THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTILUS ! EXACTLY THERE WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL ! WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU ! OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY ! EXACTLY HERE REPLIED THE BRAHMAN ! AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT ! WHERE WAS THE TIGER THEN ! BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING ! WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE ! SO ARCHIAS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY ! VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY ! HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY ! SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHMAN ! AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY ! THEN SHUT AND BOLT IT SAID THE JACKAL ! WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS ! HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMYNTAS THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE ! SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS ! BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD ! WHEN THE BRAHMAN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER ! ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING ! EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS ! WHEN THE GOOD BRAHMAN OPENED YOUR CAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE ! THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING ! EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND ! THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE ! HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE ! PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRAHMAN ! NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED ! YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MINE THIS ! THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMON !

THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE ! WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME ! THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES ! SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE ! IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR ! THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE !

THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION ! CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDY NOW ! THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HORSES ! THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LEER IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN !

BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANKATO ! WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD ! THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER ! THE VALET LEFT THE ROOM ! FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO ! GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME ! NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POSTHASTE INTO MANKATO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US ! THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS ! YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST ! THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED ! NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS ! HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH IT PILLOWED ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP ! THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM ! YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES SEVEN ! AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS ! IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLY ! BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT ! RACHEL LAKE RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW !

PESTE I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE !

SIX STEPPED TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T L VOUGHT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J SEVERSON ! ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS ! FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED ! HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGOT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY ! MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF ! IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS ! LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WYLDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOG CART FOR MARK BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS ! THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE ! BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LION WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN ! COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIEN ! THERE IS NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN ! HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING ! I GOT UP AS THE SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY ! LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CROWN ! ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE ! WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS ! SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATONWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW !
6128-63240.5442-41168.533-131564 ! THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES ! THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT ! THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN ! HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT ! VAIN HOPE I FEAR ! HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE ! MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISTER HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE ! SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ORDER A BALLOT ! SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT ! WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY ! JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK A DAY ASPECT ! NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME ! HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE ! THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT ! I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU ! VOTES PLEASE BEASTLY ! IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU OUGHT TO HAVE FORMED LONG AGO ! IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES ! THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED ! WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM ! THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL ! NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF BAD AS I AM ! LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE ! THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA ! NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES ! HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT ! AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD ! BUT TELL ME SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR SONS TO BE LIKE MISTER HUNTINGDON OR EVEN LIKE YOURSELF ! AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM ! OH NO I COULDN'T STAND THAT ! WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS ! BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT ! FIRE AND FURY ! TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR ! IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER ! NOW DON'T BURST INTO A TEMPEST AT THAT ! HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEERED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY ! HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY ! BUT HANG IT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT ! LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT ! NOT YEARS FOR SHE'S ONLY FIVE AND TWENTY ! SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER ! SERGEY IVANOVITCH FROWNED ! WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF ME AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WORRY HER TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM ! HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE ! THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY ! I KNOW THEY ARE BLESS THEM ! NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE ! HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND ! SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT ! A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST ! HE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LIBRARY ! SANG OUT THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R ! THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA ! I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL ! ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE ! THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO NUTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX ! THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON TO OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS ! AND MISSUS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO ! BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED ! ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR ! IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE ! I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT D N ME IF I DON'T ! THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTEE BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN ! BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO ! IF YOU INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY AND HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE ! THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS ! IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE ! SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE ! AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR ! HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE ! THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION ! GOD HELP ME THEN FOR I'M SURE I NEED IT ! HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE ! TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM ! I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY ! WHERE'S MILICENT ! MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE ! NAY NOT I SAID HE TURNING HER ROUND AND PUSHING HER TOWARDS ME !

COSETTE HAD WAKED UP ! HER TASTES ALL LAY IN THIS DIRECTION HER IDEA BEING BY AND BY TO FOLLOW HER MOTHER'S PROFESSION OF JOURNALISM FOR WHICH SHE ALREADY SHOWED CONSIDERABLE APTITUDE !

LESLIE THANKED HER AND EAGERLY GRASPED THE LITTLE PARCEL ! YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT ! I'M WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUNG MAN ! JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVING ! IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE ! FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON ! BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR !

LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ! THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL ! AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER ! I HAVE BEEN STARVING OR RATHER I HAVE BEEN THIRSTING ! I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE ! WELL READ IT IN PEACE SAID LESLIE I WON'T DISTURB YOU ! NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN ! I AM TRULY GLAD IT HAS COME !

ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED ! SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT ! BUT THEY ARE JUST SHUTTING UP !

THIS OFFERS THE MEANS BUT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE ! BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL ! DON'T BEGIN SAID ANNIE ! HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN SIX FEET ! DON'T BEGIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN ! IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH ! THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH ! THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER ! I MEAN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS ! AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEADPENCIL ! HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS ! I WALKED UP AND DOWN AS FAST AS EVER I COULD OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF SLEEPY !

ANNIE STARED VACANTLY AT THE COCOA THEN SHE UTTERED A LAUGH ! FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE ! WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL ! BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK ! DRINK THAT SHE SAID ! RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION ! DO YOU WANT TO KILL ME DON'T TALK ANY MORE ! JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS ! I AM SLEEPY I SHALL SLEEP ! ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE ! AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I ! WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE ! AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER ! SHE GOT INTO BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY ROUND HER ! TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS ! CAN'T YOU MANAGE WITH A CANDLE JUST FOR ONCE ! BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW ! YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE ! BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK ! A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE ! IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING ! CERTAINLY SAID LESLIE ! IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I'LL LAND MY FISH ! WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN ! I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE THANKS LAUGHED KENNETH ! THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS ! SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED ! WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU ! BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED ! THE OLD ADAGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW ! IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE ! ANNIE'S MANNER WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS ! YES IT STILL HOLDS GOOD ! AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET ! ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANYONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE ! I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS ! TIRED OUT LESLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP ! THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN ! ANNIE IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT ! THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE ! NO ALIMONY REPEATED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT ! THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN ! AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW ! ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER !
6432-63723.8188-269290.3764-168671 ! CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK ! THE GUILD OF SAINT ELIZABETH ! AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREEL COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW ! ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS ! THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH ! THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS ! IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LESLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL ! A MOURNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED ! I'M NOT COMING SAID ANNIE ! BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG ! NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT ! THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE ! HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY ! THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES ! WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN ! EVERY STUDENT IS TO BE IN EAST HALL AT HALF PAST EIGHT ! IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM ! IT DOESN'T MATTER REPLIED ANNIE WHETHER IT IS AN ORDER OR NOT I'M NOT COMING SAY NOTHING ABOUT ME PLEASE ! IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT ! DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT ! IT BURNED AS IF WITH FEVER ! THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VAUGIRARD IT HINTED AT POVERTY PERE LACHAISE IF YOU PLEASE ! YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID ! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A TRIAL IT IS FOR ME TO HAVE YOU HERE ! THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM ! I WANT TO BE ALONE GO ! TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT ! AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED ! I KNOW YOU DON'T QUITE MEAN WHAT YOU SAY SAID LESLIE BUT OF COURSE IF YOU REALLY WISH ME ! THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN TO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT ! YOU FRET ME BEYOND ENDURANCE ! HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER ! IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY ! WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE ! SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER ! THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES ! BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE ! IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE ! LESLIE WAS JUST CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WHEN ANNIE CALLED AFTER HER ! MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES ! I TOOK IT OUT SAID LESLIE TOOK IT OUT ! A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE ! LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION ! FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND ! SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE ! HAVE THE GOODNESS TO FIND IT AND PUT IT BACK ! NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT ! JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS ! AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP ! BUT DON'T LOCK ME OUT PLEASE ANNIE ! WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING ! OH I WON'T LOCK YOU OUT SHE SAID BUT I MUST HAVE THE KEY ! STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ! HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTIENNE ! THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED ! HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM ! IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK ! JANE HERIOT'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE ! GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE ! AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD IT BEING TURNED IN THE LOCK ! LARCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER ! WHAT CAN THIS MEAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF ! IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER ! OH I WON'T PRESS YOU REPLIED JANE ! AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED ! THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED ! OH I SHALL NEVER DO THAT REPLIED LESLIE ! TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY ! HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM ! YOU SEE ALL THE GIRLS EXCEPT EILEEN AND MARJORIE LAUGH AT HER AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO MAKE HER WORSE ! AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE ! THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER ! SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES ! SOME DAY JANE YOU MUST SEE HER ! THE GRAVE DIGGER YES ! IF YOU ARE IN LONDON DURING THE SUMMER YOU MUST COME AND PAY US A VISIT WILL YOU ! YOU I ! THAT IS IF YOU CARE TO CONFIDE IN ME ! FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS ! I BELIEVE POOR ANNIE IS DREADFULLY UNHAPPY ! AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS ! THAT'S JUST IT JANE THAT IS WHAT FRIGHTENS ME SHE REFUSES TO COME ! THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE ! FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS THAT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE ! BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE ! REFUSES TO COME SHE CRIED ! IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL ! SHE WILL GET INTO AN AWFUL SCRAPE ! IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES ! I AM SURE SHE IS ILL SHE WORKS TOO HARD AND SHE BUT THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO SAY ANY MORE ! HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER ! I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE SAID LESLIE ! MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER ! BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER ! DO COME ANNIE DO ! DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOIR IS HE IS A JUG OF RED WINE ! SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LESLIE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO THE MEETING ! DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT ! BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LESLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL ! I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME ! MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM ! BUT YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO ! THEN A ROLL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANNIE COLCHESTER ! ARE YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY ! IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR ! THE MAN REPLIED ! THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED ! SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT UP ! HEAR HEAR AND ONCE AGAIN HEAR ! HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY ! SHE UTTERED HER STRANGE REMARK STANDING UP ! THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM ! MARJORIE AND EILEEN WERE CLOSE TO HER ! IT WAS HIGH LARCH ! FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED GRIBIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW ! THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO ! I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ACHESON PRESENTLY SHE SAID ! BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME ! FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED ! THE NAMES OF PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK ! SO FATHER MESTIENNE IS DEAD ! AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER ! THE MAN REPLIED COMPLETELY ! ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED ! THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTE BOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTIENNE DIED ! YOU ASK SHE CONTINUED ! GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH RABBIT ! STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE ! THANK YOU NO ! YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN ! GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU ARE ! FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I AM LOST ! THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES YOU ARE ! THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER ! I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE ! ALL MEN ARE YOUR BROTHERS ! NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER ! AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL ! FOR ALL WHO SIN ALL WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE ! THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY ! FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED ! THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED ! AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED ! THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW ! IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL ! MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRYTANEUM TOWN HALL ! I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE ! BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER ! I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU ! SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN ! I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT ! JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME UP ! RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS ! ANNIE COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID ! WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ASKED ! HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY ! I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK ! BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS ! FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY ! THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET ! I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LESLIE DISTRESS NOW IN HER TONE ! IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER ! THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE ! I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED ! ONE MUST EAT ! THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER !
6938-70848.4198-61336.3005-163399 ! EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON ! PHELPS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE ! IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHUR BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED ! THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED ! AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING ! I WENT AROUND AND CLUMB OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASH HOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN ! ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS ! WELL MIGHT SHARDURIS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD ! WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING ! I OUT WITH A YES'M BEFORE I THOUGHT ! HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVILS ! TIGLATH PILESER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE URARTIAN ARMY IN QUMMUKH ! SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER ! A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS ! WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GERMAN ! AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING SHARDURIS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY ! WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS ! DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URARTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA ! WELL IT'S LUCKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HURT ! THE SHIFTY MATI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHARDURIS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION ! WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THEY BELLOWED AT HIM ! TIGLATH PILESER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN ! YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU'RE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA ! AND I THINK HE DIED AFTERWARDS HE WAS A BAPTIST ! THE PEASANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS ! YES IT WAS MORTIFICATIONTHAT WAS IT ! WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKINGMEN LIKE OURSELVES ! YOUR UNCLE'S BEEN UP TO THE TOWN EVERY DAY TO FETCH YOU ! THESE MEN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS ! YOU MUST A MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN'T YOU OLDISH MAN WITH A ! THESE LAST WERE THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY ! FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE ! WHY CHILD IT LL BE STOLE ! ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATI ILU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH ! IT WAS KINDER THIN ICE BUT I SAYS ! ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA ! I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS ! WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL ! ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE ! PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILLS STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS ! JEHOASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS ! I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND ! SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHALLUM ! DOWN WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKED ! THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SAMARIA FOR ONLY A MONTH ! FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI ! NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MENAHEM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION ! SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RESK THE TRUTH ! TIGLATH PILESER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST ! I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES ! UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION ! HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWORD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON ! MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS ! CHILDREN DON'T YOU SAY A WORD ! BY DECLARING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ! THUS WAS URARTU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES ! BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS ! I SEE I WAS IN A FIX NOW ! ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ! MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM AND SAYS ! THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ! HAS HE COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND ! IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH PILESER RETURNED TO SYRIA ! I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY ! FOLLOWED HIM LENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY ! MENAHEM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEKAHIAH ! UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED ! THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND LAND OWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED ! HE MUST A COME AND YOU'VE MISSED HIM ALONG THE ROAD ! JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE ! OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESSED ! THE DUMAS AND ZEMSTVOS WERE DROPPED ! WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING ! HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED ! HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED ! THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND SAYS ! FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL ! I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS IT ! HE SPOKE TO THE RUMP CONVENTION ! IT'S TOM SAWYER ! THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END ! BEING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER ! BUT THE PRESENT MOVEMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE ! THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH ! THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT ! ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH !
7902-96592.3331-159605.1998-29454 ! SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE ! A THOUSAND BLESSINGS FROM A GRATEFUL HEART ! SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PUTTEL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED ! I'M GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST ! THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT ! SHALL I COME TOO FATHER NO ! PERUSAL SAID THE PAWNBROKER THAT'S THE WAY TO PERNOUNCE IT ! STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY NANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER ! I VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN ! HIS BOOKS TOLD HIM THAT TREASURE IS BEST HIDDEN UNDER LOOSE BOARDS UNLESS OF COURSE YOUR HOUSE HAS A SECRET PANEL WHICH HIS HAD NOT ! JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES ! TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT ! HE GOT IT UP AND PUSHED HIS TREASURES AS FAR IN AS HE COULD ALONG THE ROUGH CRUMBLY SURFACE OF THE LATH AND PLASTER ! WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM ! WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SLIGHTLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK THE HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY ! THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RAYSTOKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP ! HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE AND IT INTERESTED HIM EXTREMELY ! WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF ! HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND KNEW THAT HE DID NOT AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WAS ! BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK ! I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT ! WHAT'S UP MATEY LOST YOUR WAY DICKIE EXPLAINED ! LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN ! AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER ! WHEN HE SAID AVE I BIN ASLEEP ! THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON ! HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER ! HERE WE ARE SAID THE MAN ! NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS ! AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE ! NOT EXACKLY SAID THE MAN BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT ! I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED ! WHEN IT WAS OVER THE MAN ASKED DICKIE IF HE COULD WALK A LITTLE WAY AND WHEN DICKIE SAID HE COULD THEY SET OUT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY SIDE BY SIDE ! NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE ! IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS ! WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT ! AND THE TEA AND ALL AN THE EGG ! ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN ! AND THIS IS THE PRETTIEST PLACE EVER I SEE ! THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE ! OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD ! LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF ! I SHALL CATCH IT A FAIR TREAT AS IT IS ! RAM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE ! AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE ! SHE WAS WAITIN FOR THE WOOD TO BOIL THE KETTLE WHEN I COME OUT MOTHER ! POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID ! AIN'T BAD WHEN SHE'S IN A GOOD TEMPER ! THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION ! THAT AIN'T WHAT SHE'LL BE IN WHEN YOU GETS BACK ! WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD N'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHAWS TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME ! HULLO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU ! I GOT TO STICK IT SAID DICKIE SADLY I'D BEST BE GETTING HOME ! A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY ! I WOULDN'T GO OME NOT IF I WAS YOU SAID THE MAN ! GO ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR I WAS SHUT IN LAST NIGHT BY MISTAKE ! NO SAID DICKIE OH NO NO I NEVER ! TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSY SAID THE MAID ! I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AND WONDERED WHOSE BOY YOU WAS ! I AIN'T IT YER HAVE I LIKE WHAT YER AUNT DO ! IT WAS YOU FATHER KICKED FOR SHIRKING AND MY WELL I HARDLY KNOWED YOU ! WELL THAT'LL SHOW YOU THE SORT OF MAN I AM ! NONSENSE ! AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING ! THE MAN'S MANNER WAS SO KIND AND HEARTY THE WHOLE ADVENTURE WAS SO WONDERFUL AND NEW IS IT COUNTRY WHERE YOU GOING ! HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD N'T THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET ! WON'T DO SAID RAM GRINNING ! SHE REALLY COULD N'T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY ! THINK I DON'T KNOW YOU MISTER ORFICER ! THE SUN SHOT LONG GOLDEN BEAMS THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE HEDGE ! WON'T DO SAID RAM QUICKLY I KNOW YOU ! THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROTHS ANSWERED POLLY ! A BIRD PAUSED IN ITS FLIGHT ON A BRANCH QUITE CLOSE AND CLUNG THERE SWAYING ! BEEN PLAYING THE SPY THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING WHO LOCKED YOU IN ! HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET A NEW ENVELOPE A NEW SHEET OF PAPER AND A NEW PENCIL READY SHARPENED BY MACHINERY ! SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF ! AN I ASKS YOU LET ME COME ALONGER YOU GOT THAT ! ARCHY STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND ! BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT ! GET IT WROTE DOWN THEN DONE ! HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE ! THEN HE FOLDED IT AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET ! THANK YOU NO ! NOW WE'RE SQUARE HE SAID ! NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY PRESENTED ITSELF ! THEY COULD PUT A MAN AWAY FOR LESS THAN THAT ! A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS BREAST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR IN VAIN ! I SEE THAT THERE IN A BOOK SAID DICKIE CHARMED ! HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS ! HE REWARD THE WAKE THE LAST OF THE ENGLISH AND I WUNNERED WHAT IT STOOD FOR ! HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION ! THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH ! WILD ONES AIN'T ALF THE SIZE I LAY ! ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL ! ADVENTURES I SHOULD THINK SO ! HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN ! BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH !

AH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS ! SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE ! IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE ! THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO !

OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS FARRINDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION ! I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY ! IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING ! YES YES ! OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES ! SUPPOSE I DO ! RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME A THOUSAND NAMES ! SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW !

SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STOKER GIRTHED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM ! SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEETMEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BHANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH HIM CHARGER AND CHEST AND ALL TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY !

OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE ! CAPTAIN MURDOCH ! EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER ! BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF ! AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER ! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT ! THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR ! SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN ! IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP ! AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL AROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER ! THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED ! THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE ! EVEN DERELICTS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING ! THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE ! BESIDE OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONALD LAUGHING ! THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT ! YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE ! THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH ! AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HAROLD I SHOULD JUDGE ! CAPTAIN MURDOCH WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN ! THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES ! THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM ! THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE ! DO YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER ! GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF ! HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY ! I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH ! SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK ! YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT ! THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL ! I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS ! THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY ! DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE ! THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONEWALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT ! WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMEN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT ! THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER ! HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS ! POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE ! HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME ! ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING ! INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE ! THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES ! THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TONIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN OKAY MEN LET'S GO ! IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS ! BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCH'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP ! THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS ON THE MIND ! ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED ! TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED ! BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION ! FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF ! EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING ! NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS ! HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THEN ! BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE ! NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM ! IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST ! THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY ! AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF ! MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT ! IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION ! THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR ! BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY ! AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH ! GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS ! INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS ! HENCE A RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER ! GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT ! GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT ! HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW ! AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS ! THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY ! NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN ! HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS ! THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST ! THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPS STARTED OFF ! SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ! TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON ! FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT ! FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GOD'S ! THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY ! WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE ! WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCH TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP ! AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE HOLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE ! IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY ! IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY ! MURDOCH INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS ! NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL ! THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON FELT ! THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS ! THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM ! THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES ! I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN ! AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY ! THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THAT MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE ! COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW ! THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION ! BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS ! MURDOCH TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TOUGHS ! NO SIR HE IS NOT HERE ! AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS ! IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU ! AND THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TO ! THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO ! NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR ! TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH ! EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES ! MURDOCH SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD ! HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING INTO HIS STATE ROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN ! IN THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE ! THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM ! WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE ! THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE ! GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED ! AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS ! BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING ! A VENTRILOQUIST ABOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN ! THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE ! NO THE COPS THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON ! I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON ! IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS ! BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WAYNE ! THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACKLEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE ! BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID ! BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM ! BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS ! BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY ! WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE ! MURDOCH BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY ! THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND ! WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAYNE WILL BE RE ELECTED ! THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD ! NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER ! THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS ! EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION ! A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP ! BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT ! NO YOU'RE A FIRSTER HE CAN'T LOSE ! GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE ! AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN ! THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN ! LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS ! IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM ! I DINKS NO I DINKS I DEACH YOU VON LESSON RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST ! AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM ! HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER ! I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY ! THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR ! EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY ! COST EM MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE ! WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE ! MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD ! SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW ! YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION ! BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT ! THEY KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT ! EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON ! BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE ! THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN A STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE ! THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCH WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT ! AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY ! WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING ! IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE ! THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREENBACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT ! THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO ! THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH ! THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS ! BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAYNE WAS RE ELECTED ! A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND !
8461-281231.2609-156975.7105-2340 ! HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THEIR WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS ! WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE ! THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN ! WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID HER HUSBAND OR DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE ! IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE ! BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING ! HOLD ON HOLD FAST HOLD OUT PATIENCE IS GENIUS ! WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY ! LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN ! AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM ! WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTER EFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT ! THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE ! A WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRID HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK ! EVERY ONE WHO IS TURBULENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KING MERNEPTAH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD ! WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR ! AND THE REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE ! LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH ULRICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL ! THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL ! FROM HIS LATE SCHOOLDAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF KLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION ! IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT ! THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOTE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRID SAYING HE'S PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS ! THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY ! EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN HO ! SIGNED WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ! THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT ! I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS ! THE LATER TRADITIONS TEND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD ! REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WOMAN ! THE TALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER ! HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM ! IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED ! A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ALSO STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHUM THE HOUSE OF RAMSES A CITY WITH A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES ! OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE ! THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID ULRICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM ! SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DUPLICATES OF COURSE ! THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURAL INEVITABLE ! SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER ! MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN ! WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM A DESPOTIC RULER OF THAT LAND AND DAY ! THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY DE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE ! THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT ! THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS ! WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES ! THE STORY OF MOSES BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY ! TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS EFFORTS TO STOP THEM ! WAS MOSES JUSTIFIED IN RESISTING THE EGYPTIAN TASKMASTER ! OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE CHANGED ! IS PEONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT ! THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL RUNG WITH THEIR FURIOUS BLOWS ! NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN ! AT LENGTH DE BRACY FELL ! THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES ! TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME ! I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT ! FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C ! YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW ! ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY ! VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF VICTORY ! EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH ! AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING ! THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER ! THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KEDEM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF ! RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS ! LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE ! HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF ! THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS ! IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO ! THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUHIT ! BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF ! THE PRIEST OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE KENITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE ! AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE ULRICA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS ! WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS ! BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE TO THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER ! NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE ! AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT ! IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU ! HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE ! WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE ! IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING ! AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE ! HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ATHELSTANE WAS LAID ! MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH ! I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER ! DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD ! DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH ! HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING ! THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY ! THE SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS ! SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST ! LADY ERNESTINE PIGEONCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPASS OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR ! MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP ! DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA ! THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING ! AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION ! HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER ! HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUST AND STRONG GOD ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED ! IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST ! THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN ! SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS ! THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FRONT DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM ! THE PIGEONCOTES HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION ! THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTOLIAN PLAIN IN CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN ! PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE ! HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE ! THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION ! BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LUCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY !
