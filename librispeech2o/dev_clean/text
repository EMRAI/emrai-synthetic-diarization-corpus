IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE ! TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST ! WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR ! THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES !

ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET ! HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US !

AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE ! IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING ! BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH ! I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING ! BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN ! HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME ! EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE ! OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME ! WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN ! ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER ! HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY ! I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING ! COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE !

AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT ! THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE ! BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN !

1673-143397.5536-43358 ! ARDENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HERESY CYRIL AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIANS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTARIES ! THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL MIND ! WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARCH AT THE DAWN OF DAY LED A SEDITIOUS MULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SYNAGOGUES ! THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED ! SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLONY ! IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCENDED TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION ! THE ZEAL OF CYRIL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE ! NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER ! ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRAEFECT OF EGYPT ! AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY ! A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PRAEFECT AND THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED ! THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAMBEDAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING ! WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITANS OF EUROPE AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOCH AND ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DIOCESE BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE ! THE FIRST BAMBEDAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE ! EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERETICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS ! KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO ! AT THESE BLASPHEMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN ! AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER ! BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSENGERS OF EGYPT ! WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS ! THE VANITY OF CELESTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MONK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLERGY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS ! IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION ! NESTORIUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR CHRYSOSTOM TO DISCLAIM THE JURISDICTION AND TO DISOBEY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT ! TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL ! SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METROPOLITAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHREN ! IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP ! BY THE VIGILANCE OF MEMNON THE CHURCHES WERE SHUT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL ! FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN ! DURING A BUSY PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPEROR TRIED EVERY METHOD EXCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONCILE THIS THEOLOGICAL QUARREL ! THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PRAYER ! RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING ! NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL ! THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAYED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE EUNUCHS AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPERSTITION AND AVARICE WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHODOX CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEAVORS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER ! WHO MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION ! BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY ! HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION ! AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONE WAS ASSAULTED WITH GOLD ! IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPING DALLIANCE OF A RICH NEIGHBOR ! THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UNPOPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF THE SCHISMATICS WHO REVERED NESTORIUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FAITH ! THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH ! A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMMYES OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED A CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD NESTORIUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AND ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES !
174-50561.5536-43359 ! FORGOTTEN TOO THE NAME OF GILLIAN THE LOVELY CAPTIVE ! HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH ! WORSE AND WORSE HE IS EVEN PRESUMED TO BE THE CAPTIVE'S SWEETHEART WHO WHEEDLES THE FLOWER THE RING AND THE PRISON KEY OUT OF THE STRICT VIRGINS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND FLIES WITH HER AT LAST IN HIS SHALLOP ACROSS THE SEA TO LIVE WITH HER HAPPILY EVER AFTER ! HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION ! BUT THIS IS A FALLACY ! THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE ! THE WANDERING SINGER APPROACHES THEM WITH HIS LUTE ! THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS ! THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER ! IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS ! LADY LADY MY ROSE WHITE LADY BUT WILL YOU NOT HEAR A ROUNDEL LADY ! INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS ! O IF YOU PLAY US A ROUNDEL SINGER HOW CAN THAT HARM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER ! THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT ! SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK THOUGH WE DANCED A WEEK WITH HER THOUGHTS A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER ! THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND OUR RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN ! BUT IF I PLAY YOU A ROUNDEL LADY GET ME A GIFT FROM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER HER FINGER RING FOR MY FINGER BRING THOUGH SHE'S PLEDGED A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY ROSE WHITE LADY ! WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER ! THE WANDERING SINGER ! BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN ! BUT I DID ONCE HAVE THE LUCK TO HEAR AND SEE THE LADY PLAYED IN ENTIRETY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN GRANTED LEAVE TO PLAY JUST ONE MORE GAME BEFORE BED TIME AND OF COURSE THEY CHOSE THE LONGEST AND PLAYED IT WITHOUT MISSING A SYLLABLE ! HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD ! THE LADIES IN YELLOW DRESSES STAND AGAIN IN A RING ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER AND ARE FOR THE LAST TIME ACCOSTED BY THE SINGER WITH HIS LUTE ! WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLOUD WITH THE RAINBOW'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF A GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP ! THE WANDERING SINGER ! WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE ! I'LL PLAY FOR YOU NOW NEATH THE APPLE BOUGH AND YOU SHALL DREAM ON THE LAWN SO SHADY LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY APPLE GOLD LADY ! HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT ! THE LADIES ! THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR ! NOW YOU MAY PLAY A SERENA SINGER A DREAM OF NIGHT FOR AN APPLE GOLD LADY FOR THE FRUIT IS NOW ON THE APPLE BOUGH AND THE MOON IS UP AND THE LAWN IS SHADY SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER ! OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP ! ONCE MORE THE SINGER PLAYS AND THE LADIES DANCE BUT ONE BY ONE THEY FALL ASLEEP TO THE DROWSY MUSIC AND THEN THE SINGER STEPS INTO THE RING AND UNLOCKS THE TOWER AND KISSES THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER ! LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING ! I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF THE LADIES ! BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN ! BED TIME CHILDREN ! THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH ! YOU SEE THE TREATMENT IS A TRIFLE FANCIFUL !
1988-147956.84-121123 ! FUCHS BROUGHT UP A SACK OF POTATOES AND A PIECE OF CURED PORK FROM THE CELLAR AND GRANDMOTHER PACKED SOME LOAVES OF SATURDAY'S BREAD A JAR OF BUTTER AND SEVERAL PUMPKIN PIES IN THE STRAW OF THE WAGON BOX ! GO DO YOU HEAR ! OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OFF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG MUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODDING IN TIME TO HIS BITES AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARD THEM ! BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT ! IT'S NO BETTER THAN A BADGER HOLE NO PROPER DUGOUT AT ALL ! AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY ! NOW WHY IS THAT OTTO ! AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE !

D'AVRIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN ! YOU'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER WHILE MISSUS SHIMERDA MAKE GOOD HOUSE ! FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS ! MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF ! WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR ! SHE MADE MISSUS SHIMERDA UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PIES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THANK ! OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE ! THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS ! DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL ! I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES ! NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION ! HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR ! SAID MORREL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER !

AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER ! MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO ! HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY ! BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES ! AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK ! GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK ! IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA ! MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER ! I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE ! MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM ! WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US ! THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE ! THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM ! IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS ! SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY ! BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER ! SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME ! THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE ! ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE ! NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE ! SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS ! THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS ! SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER ! THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS ! WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US !

IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET ! HOW WE MUST SIMPLIFY ! AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK ! IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY ! I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE ! IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO ! THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES ! WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING ! THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE ! AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD ! I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME ! FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSCURED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN ! IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH ! IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTIN ! CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH ! I BECAME GROTESQUELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER ! THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE ! YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU ! IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD ! WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET ! IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT ! IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING ! IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM ! BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH ! THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION ! AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING ! THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION ! IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION ! WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION ! WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER ! THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION ! SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX !
1988-24833.8297-275154 ! THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME ! NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB ! SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING ! THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER ! SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SURE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA ! THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL ! WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME ! RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT ! RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF ! HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SYDENHAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM ! I EXPLAIN THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BIOLOGY ALGEBRA ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS ! HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM ! POP IT'S A COURSE ! RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW ! HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN A ROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER ! AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT ! I'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE ! YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY ! SOMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HUH ! HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY ! SO HE CARES HUH ! WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER ! BESIDES SAYS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE ! HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION ! AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY IT ! RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS ! I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH ! I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER ! POP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHANNEL ! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK ! YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF ! I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE ! IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP YOURSELF ! I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF ! I HEAR THE T V GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM ! OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS ! WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S T V PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT ! I'M AFRAID HE SAID ! I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN ! I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW ! I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL ! HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD ! IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND ! WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT ! I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA ! YOU CAN'T DO IT ! TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY ! LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST ! TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB ! I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY ! YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY ! SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE ! I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY ! LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY ! I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM ! HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY ! HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE !
1993-147965.2086-149214 ! GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT ! THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT ! MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL ! IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND ! HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US ! THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE ! BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE ! IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE ! ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM ! HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR ! AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED !
2035-147961.2277-149897 ! PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW ! WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER ! PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER ! HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT ! SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US ! NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING ! WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK ! HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE ! THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW ! HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM ! THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON ! IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP ! I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED ! THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE ! THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM ! YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY ! IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE ! ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT ! THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST ! THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS ! HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM ! HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT ! QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT ! SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED ! HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP ! IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT ! ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY ! FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING ! FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS ! ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED ! GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US ! IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED ! WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN ! HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK ! MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM ! HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT ! AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE ! HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM ! THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS ! THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER ! A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY ! THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT ! SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED ! HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE ! THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER ! ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA ! THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND ! IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE ! THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED ! IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING ! AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US ! HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY ! THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW ! HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE ! YES HOW MANY ! HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS ! TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH ! HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER ! NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO ! HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY ! PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM ! HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE ! PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING ! HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY ! THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS ! HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED ! THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE ! ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ ! WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM ! DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY ! THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE ! VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE ! DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES ! SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT ! EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER ! IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY ! THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA !
2035-152373.7850-286674 ! THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES ! A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO ! THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION ! IT IS DISGRACEFUL ! IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA ! THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL ! THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY ! THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS ! LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE ! YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID ! IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE ! THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES ! LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN ! BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE ! THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA ! WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH ! AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER ! OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER ! THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA ! THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD ! THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER ! INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD ! THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS ! BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY ! NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL ! SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE ! WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE ! HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE ! SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE ! SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT ! HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST ! THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER ! THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY ! HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL ! SAINT MOLING SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SAINT ADAMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS ! THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY ! NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD !
2086-149220.3170-137482 ! THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET ! WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED ! THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSEBUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS ! I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY ! THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING ! I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE ! SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST ! BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL ! PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY ! OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER ! BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY ! WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES ! THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES ! WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH ! IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN ! WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS ! IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE ! THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS ! THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE ! IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZZINO ! THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS ! YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY ! THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPZIBAH'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE ! THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZZINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH ! THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COOP AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER ! WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT ! SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY ! WHERE IS MY HUSBAND ! HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES ! NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW ! THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD ! MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH ! MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILL INTERWEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PYNCHEON ! TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF ! AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL ! IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING ! I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PYNCHEON ! THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED ! MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGUERREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA ! I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM ! I TURN UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME ! I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE ! IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT ! I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING ! IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE ! I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME ! MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO ! TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME ! THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE ! THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED ! WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT ! THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE ! YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION ! HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM ! HE EXHIBITED A DAGUERREOTYPE MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE ! THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION ! PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK ! DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN ! I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET ! HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH ! THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART ! WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES ! HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE ! UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT ! AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL ! I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY ! WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT ! THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED ! IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD ! I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE ! IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE ! HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER ! IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ! IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER ! SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE ! THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS ! SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABORERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM ! NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION ! SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM ! THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE ! OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED ! BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT ! SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS A CORNER ! THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES ! BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE ! AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS ! WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS THE HUMAN VOICE ! I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM ! HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL ! BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND ! FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM ! WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE ! PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST ! YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH ! I WILL SIT IN THE PARLOR AWHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS ! YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND ! WHILE THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPT FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL ! I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER ! AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION !
2277-149896.5895-34629 ! HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE ! IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK ! HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID ! THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS ! HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION ! SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ! HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION ! HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR ! HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT ! IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX ! MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED ! IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE ! HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY ! AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE ! HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL ! THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN ! FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED ! BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS ! WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS ! WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY ! SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT ! THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES ! HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING ! WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL ! SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING ! ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN ! HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE ! THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE ! AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR ! GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC ! HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE ! BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN ! FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER ! EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS ! AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM ! THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL ! HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL ! IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE ! BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY ! THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE ! THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK ! THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS ! WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH ! BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK ! LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF ! URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED ! SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE ! AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE ! HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP ! THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS ! HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET ! THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN ! THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM ! HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM ! HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING ! WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS ! HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA ! HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM ! HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING ! THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR ! HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE ! ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM ! HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW ! WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD ! BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT ! HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL ! THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER ! AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS ! HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER !
2412-153947.2035-147960 ! PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION ! SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER ! THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE ! THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER ! ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER ! ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED ! THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER ! THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE ! I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY ! IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE ! I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE ! I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN ! BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER ! I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED ! I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES ! I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY ! IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGITATA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ! A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD ! I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION ! LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID ! I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO ! I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES ! I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH ! WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK ! THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE ! I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE ! THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY ! OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET ! I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE ! HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD ! I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD ! OTTO WINKED AT ME ! THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS ! A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE !
2412-153954.1272-135031 ! SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE ! BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE ! MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM ! HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST ! THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN ! I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS ! THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME ! THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR ! EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST ! THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU ! EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT ! I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO ! THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY ! I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO ! EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN ! HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING ! THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL ! I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY ! I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN ! HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL ! THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY ! IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY ! I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED ! NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO ! THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING ! WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW ! I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS ! INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST ! IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER ! WHERE IS THAT ! SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME ! THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO ! IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT ! KALIKO HESITATED ! THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM ! HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS ! THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT ! OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T ! BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH ! THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY ! AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS ! I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE ! WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES ! I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY ! THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME ! TRUE AGREED KALIKO ! THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM ! KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS ! HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER ! HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD !
2428-83699.1462-170142 ! I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON ! THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE ! FESTIVE YES ! EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE ! THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE ! SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS ! IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER ! THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED ! THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD ! A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE ! THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT ! SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT ! NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY ! SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER ! I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE ! I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY ! UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO ! WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD ! I HAD NO ILLUSIONS ! SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH ! I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT ! I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY ! ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING ! HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY ! I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS ! HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES ! I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON ! IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT ! IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY ! ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW ! HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON ! IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE ! IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF ! I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER ! WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO ! I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER ! NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DENE THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION ! THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING ! THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING ! AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH ! WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART ! SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER ! IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE ! COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED ! I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT ! HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE ! I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT ! I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT ! I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY ! AFTER THE VERY FIRST ! I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE ! HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN ! HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO ! SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL ! THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM ! SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO ! THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF ! PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE ! THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY ! YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY ! NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL ! I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG ! BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD ! SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR ! MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING ! YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED ! THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE ! BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH ! PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR ! IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA ! A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE ! OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO ! THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER ! YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME ! THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE ! I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING ! WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD ! HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS ! I TOLLED THE BELL AGAIN ! YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT ! AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND ! AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE ! I'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON ! SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER ! WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT ! DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED !
251-136532.174-168635 ! THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA ! HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND ! BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS ! THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY ! THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY ! HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM ! THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED ! HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING ! THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD ! ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT ! THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME ! COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING ! TONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS ! SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION ! IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE ! THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY ! GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM ! NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF ! WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION ! TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER ! MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT ! WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY ! NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT ! MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL ! A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR ! HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN ! MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS ! WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL ! YES CHARCOAL ! COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING ! SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP ! AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY ! THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING ! HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE ! TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET ! THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS ! WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY ! HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM ! NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY ! WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE ! BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT ! ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE ! SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO ! HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM ! LECTURES ! HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PROP ! THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR !
2803-154328.251-118436 ! THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY ! HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE ! THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH ! I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED ! THE MEAL ENDED ! SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM ! SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING ! AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW ! IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE ! A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM HIS MOUTH ! GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW ! THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER ! GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED ! THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD ! JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN ! NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY ! I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE ! WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR ! MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT ! THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDHYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT ! AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT ! POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER ! THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED ! ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS ! ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK ! BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BHUNDA CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE ! LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP ! BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT ! ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT ! ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS ! WILSON AND OLBINETT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING ! THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY ! WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT ! THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS ! DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING ! THEIR FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE ! THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION ! I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE ! JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT ! THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH ! BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES ! YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST ! WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT ! THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER ! ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE ! YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND ! MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU ! SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ASURA !
2803-161169.2902-9008 ! ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES ! THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CALLIMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON ! THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS ! THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE ! WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING ! BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE ! AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE ! SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN ! THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US ! IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN ELECT ! WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES ! IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE VULGAR HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA ! LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE ! TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE ! SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM ! I TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORPHYRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL EYES AND MAGIC ! HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR ! WHAT DO I CARE FOR FOOD ! FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES ! HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH ! FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL ! AY SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS ! WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY ! THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH ! THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE ! STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS ! THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND ! NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER ! BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY ! AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED ! IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT ! HIS EXCELLENCY MADAM THE PREFECT ! DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR ! AND WHY SHOULD THAT DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER ! WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM !
2902-9006.1673-143396 ! ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE ! A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES ! IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE ! THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS ! NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES ! YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST ! THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS ! HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS ! THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE ! HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY ! JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS ! THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM ! BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT ! NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY ! IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES ! BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST ! THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL ! MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST ! BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS ! HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES ! THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT ! BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY ! AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND ! A FOETUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER ! TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE ! IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY ! THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND ! WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEROMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE ! HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES ! BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE ! THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITOL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSE HIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA ! THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CERINTHUS ! THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE ! THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES ! CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE ! YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION ! THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMOOUSIOS AND HOMOIOUSIOS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFETE REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE ! HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE ! TO SYNESIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY ! BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH ! I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS ! UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABBOT SERAPION HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATIGABLE ARDOR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PERUSED THE FOUR GOSPELS THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES AND THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS !
3000-15664.2428-83705 ! SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES ! HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST ! ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS ! BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS ! PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF ! I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED ! GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU ! IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL ! BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT ! IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT ! ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT ! FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING ! ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED ! THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING ! THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME ! THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT ! YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME ! I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED ! AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST ! THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT ! EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR ! FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE ! SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF ! I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES ! THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL ! I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT ! A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE ! IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS ! IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE ! THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW ! IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE ! WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT ! IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING ! THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE ! IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH ! I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS ! THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN ! IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR ! MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT ! AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS ! TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY ! IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT ! REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS ! I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST ! HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN ! A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US ! MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION ! I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT ! LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM ! AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER ! WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK ! I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT ! THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY ! OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING ! THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE ! HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS ! BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE ! SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS ! THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS ! I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS ! THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH ! THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE ! TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK ! SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE ! THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE ! BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND ! THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA ! WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO ! THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE ! THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY ! SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT ! AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE ! UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS ! SOMEONE SNIGGERED ! THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM ! I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE ! ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HEUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA !

AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES ! WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE ! TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP ! A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE ! THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING ! HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT !

3081-166546.777-126732 ! WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE ! ALL IDEALISATION MAKES LIFE POORER ! INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS ! THEN WHY INDULGE IN PROPHETIC PHANTASIES ! YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE ! AT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROPHET AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECTIVE VALUE ! THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT ! MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WHEEZED AS IF DEADENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST ! THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER ! AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WEIGHT DOWN AS MUCH AS AN OUNCE ! GEORGE NODDED ! WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND IN A DUMMY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE ! THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT ! YES I HAD THE TIME TO THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS ! DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME ! WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND DEFORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORIBUND MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB ! GEORGE ! HIS ENUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER ! HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE ! THE OLD TERRORIST TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE ! I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE ! AND I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER ! THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT ! THE POSSESSORS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THE AWAKENED PROLETARIAT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES ! A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING ! STRUGGLE WARFARE WAS THE CONDITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATAL ! I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER ! AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF NO DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LURID SUNS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE ! I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY ! DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT ! I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW ! A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE OSSIPON CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND A BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXALTED EYES ! JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH ! ALEXANDER OSSIPON GOT UP TALL IN HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMMOBILITY AND STROLLED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEVIE'S SHOULDER ! YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS ! VERY CHARACTERISTIC PERFECTLY TYPICAL ! WHAT DOES HE WANT ! YOU WOULD CALL THAT LAD A DEGENERATE WOULD YOU MUMBLED MISTER VERLOC ! I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE ! IT WAS KARL YUNDT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH ! HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME ! LOMBROSO IS AN ASS ! I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY ! FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE IS IT NOT ! HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE ! THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTURING ! HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM ! THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE ! THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN ! THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME ! I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON ! MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT ! HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS ! HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER HIMSELF ! HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT ! HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY ! IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE ! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INTIMIDATED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND ! THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT ! HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS ! THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED ! STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM ! THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM ! THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN ! IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE ! HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN ! BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE ! COMRADE OSSIPON'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION ! THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN ! I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MICHAELIS GENTLY ! AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE ! HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT IT THIS TIME ! IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE ! THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY ! THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR ! THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OSSIPON'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE ! SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER ! HE PAUSED THEN ADDED WITH MODEST FIRMNESS ! NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL ! I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS ! IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN ! THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE ! WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE ! STEVIE SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR ! I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL ! HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT ! A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD ! HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS ! HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE ! WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT ! THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE ! THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS ! BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY ! IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME ! VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME ! LOAFING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR ! WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS ! THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE ! BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES ! THIS SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE ! OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING ! HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS ! WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW ! HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION ! ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL ! MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE ! NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST ! HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE ! MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG ! HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN ! HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS ! STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE ! WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY ! THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLAITS FOR THE NIGHT ! ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN ! HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE ! YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES ! THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE ! I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY ! IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN ! AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON ! THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL ! NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING ! THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD ! YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED ! YES NOT AT ALL WELL ! NO DOUBT ! DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM ! SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT ! THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK ! NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME ! THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED ! WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR ! THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD ! IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE ! MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING ! BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU ! THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE ! VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL ! IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID ! I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS ! HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT ! AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE ! MISTER VERLOC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW ! THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE ! ASK KARL YUNDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY ! YES ! HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE ! FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY ! HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT ! YES MANY TIMES ! HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS ! WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE ! I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY ! MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY ! HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM ! NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY ! I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT ! AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION ! THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE ! I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW ! HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY ! THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND ! COMFORTABLE DEAR ! THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER !
3536-23268.1993-147149 ! SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION ! HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH ! EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS ! WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS ! YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE ! THE GHOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAULKED OF ITS PREY ! NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN ! THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT ! I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME ! MARGARET MET JEM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME ! I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME ! SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN ! YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT ! SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM ! MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED ! OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE ! NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE ! IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU ! MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR ! BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM ! AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR ! WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY ! HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING ! THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT ! IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S ! HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS ! DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL ! MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME ! IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW ! THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING ! NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING ! AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HAN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME ! MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED ! BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY ! AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND ! OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU ! MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET ! HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR ! MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE ! DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF ! MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM ! MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED ! HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER ! HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR ! DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED ! SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN ! AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA ! HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY ! DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN ! I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WI HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM ! IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY ! I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF ! FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM ! BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT ! WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST ! THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES ! SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED ! THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE ! ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY ! IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER ! KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH ! BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON !
3536-8226.1272-141231 ! IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES ! A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST ! AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE ! SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE ! AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR ! THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT ! IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL ! HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST ! MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER ! ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZER SOUNDED ! AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS ! A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT ! A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND ! THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION ! OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE ! ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE ! THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW ! HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS ! HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE ! THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH ! WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN ! PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS ! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD ! THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND ! DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS ! I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDD IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE ! IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT ! THE TWENTIES ! BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B ! HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT ! TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED ! THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP ! DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN ! TEN SECONDS ! THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE ! HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES ! BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS !

NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER ! YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN ! STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE ! WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT ! TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE INCLOSURE ! THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT ! THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND ! WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN ! THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER ! SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER ! EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP ! BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID !
5338-284437.8297-275155 ! IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE ! ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SYDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER ! HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN ! THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT ! WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN ! AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE ! EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE ! RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH ! DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED ! WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER ! THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD ! MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER ! THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY ! MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL ! THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE ! HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN ! SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS ! SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY ! SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY ! BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS ! HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN ! THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND ! WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN ! BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS ! THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST ! YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW ! SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE ! SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTY ! ARE YOU A GIANT ! YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US ! PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY ! YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER ! THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL ! HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM ! CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN ! WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE ! EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM ! AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW ! BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY ! WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED ! THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS ! BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER ! IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE ! HONESTLY ! IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE ! AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN ! NO OUR WAY IS BEST ! SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD ! THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER ! THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS ! I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE ! RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE ! AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD ! A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED ! A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE ! HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECK ! IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE ! NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW ! YES IT WAS WET AN STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT ! IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND ! YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY ! GOOD BY DEAR RANDAL ! IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND ! ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN ! WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU ! WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN ! I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST !
5895-34615.2277-149874 ! BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY ! MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR ! SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE ! TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL ! HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT ! TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE ! ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE ! HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE ! IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION ! HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM ! GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK ! SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION ! HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM ! THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED ! IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF ! THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RAG CARPET ! THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR ! THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT ! NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS ! ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING ! ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT ! NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE ! AN EVERLASTING LAUGH ! HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE ! THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL ! MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF ! THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT ! YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR ! WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING ! SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM ! THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY ! SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID ! BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA ! ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH ! BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE ! A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEWCOMER ! GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR ! IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK ! HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH ! NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE ! ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT ! IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET ! THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD ! THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY !
5895-34622.5694-64025 ! WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES ! SHILOH ! IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE ! THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED ! WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING ! I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA ! FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE ! ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDEN'S ! THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS ! AS GLADDEN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING ! THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX ! ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY ! ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE ! WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE ! THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING ! THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA ! THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE ! THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS ! UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT ! WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY ! THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING ! I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS ! SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE ! I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY ! THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER ! OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE ! THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS ! ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED ! FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION ! BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW ! PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE ! SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY ! URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER ! ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES ! THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE ! ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE ! THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER ! HE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT ! A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT ! I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO ! URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES ! MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE ! THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM ! SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP ! THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR ! THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK ! URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA ! ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART !
6241-66616.5694-64038 ! BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED ! ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE ! ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS ! YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY ! WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED ! WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON ! A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS ! OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY ! THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSOME'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST ! WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP ! FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION ! HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS ! MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE ! A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER ! THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI ! THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY ! CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD ! A MAN IN THE WELL ! WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AS AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD ! THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD ! ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN ! RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT ! CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR'S SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS ! BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM ! THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS ! THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT ! IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS ! WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR ! AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS ! I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE ! BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS ! WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER ! NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK ! WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT ! A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM ! HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES ! BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS ! WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT ! THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE ! HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO ! SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER ! BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW ! WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS ! YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW ! WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN ! THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST ! THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGOON'S REPLY ! THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE ! ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER ! A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT ! THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE ! HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT !
6295-244435.3576-138058 ! CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOMECOMING !

BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY ! AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA ! BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE ! WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME ! THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY ! DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES !

BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED ! HOW NOW TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE ! ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS ! DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD ! THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE ! DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD ! LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE ! DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED ! THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY ! SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM ! THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM ! HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM ! EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH ! DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF ! AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT ! SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS ! BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER ! DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY ! COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY ! HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST ! WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE ! HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED ! HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE ! HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO SPARE FOR FOLLOWING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES ! HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE !

GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY ! WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN ! NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KNACK OF MATCHMAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTORS THE ENCHANTERS CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACQUEY'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONE THIS MINUTE ! IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL ! THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE ! FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE !

HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS ! ON PERCEIVING THIS CLAUDIA WHEN SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT HER BELOVED HUSBAND WAS NO MORE RENT THE AIR WITH HER SIGHS AND MADE THE HEAVENS RING WITH HER LAMENTATIONS SHE TORE HER HAIR AND SCATTERED IT TO THE WINDS SHE BEAT HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF GRIEF AND SORROW THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED TO COME FROM AN AFFLICTED HEART !

CLAUDIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HER AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN TEARS ! PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION ! SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING !

IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY ! AT THIS INSTANT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SQUIRES WHO WERE POSTED AS SENTINELS ON THE ROADS TO WATCH WHO CAME ALONG THEM AND REPORT WHAT PASSED TO THEIR CHIEF CAME UP AND SAID SENOR THERE IS A GREAT TROOP OF PEOPLE NOT FAR OFF COMING ALONG THE ROAD TO BARCELONA ! THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY ! WHAT LED ME INTO IT WAS A CERTAIN THIRST FOR VENGEANCE WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE QUIETEST HEARTS ! BILL SKELLY AN HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE UP ! AND IF YOU HAVE ANY DESIRE TO SHORTEN THE JOURNEY AND PUT YOURSELF EASILY IN THE WAY OF SALVATION COME WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO BECOME A KNIGHT ERRANT A CALLING WHEREIN SO MANY HARDSHIPS AND MISHAPS ARE ENCOUNTERED THAT IF THEY BE TAKEN AS PENANCES THEY WILL LODGE YOU IN HEAVEN IN A TRICE ! HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT ! AND NOW THE SQUIRES DESPATCHED TO MAKE THE PRIZE CAME UP BRINGING WITH THEM TWO GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK TWO PILGRIMS ON FOOT AND A COACH FULL OF WOMEN WITH SOME SIX SERVANTS ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK IN ATTENDANCE ON THEM AND A COUPLE OF MULETEERS WHOM THE GENTLEMEN HAD WITH THEM ! IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS ! THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED ! HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY ! THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY ! THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE ! ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS ! BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED ! THEY WERE ALL TAKEN ABACK AND NOT ONE OF THEM DARED TO UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIM !
6295-64301.5694-64029 ! ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA ! WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN ! IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY ! THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY ! WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH ! OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO ! HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT ! FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY ! EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL ! THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF ! BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE THEN ! I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME ! WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS ! SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY ! JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS ! I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND ! THE NETTLE AND THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH ! MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT ! HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT ! I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN ! HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE ! HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM ! LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR ! I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US ! THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS ! WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT ! BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC ! LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE ! THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE ! BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS ! HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING ! THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE ! A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY ! I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK ! LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC ! THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT ! LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD ! WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK ! IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM ! WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE ! NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN ! WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN ! I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF ! OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW ! HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF A PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD ! THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED ! WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE ! WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON ! HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN ! I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE ! A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM ! I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER ! THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER ! AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG ! HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID ! I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD ! HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL ! HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN ! IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD ! BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES ! HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE ! HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK ! HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD ! BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US ! IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED ! OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK !
6313-66125.6241-61943 ! YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE ! ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VALKYRIE ! LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT ! BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER ! YES AGREED TAD THAT DOES LOOK LIKE BUSHES ! WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND ! DON'T MOVE AROUND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT ! MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET ! AND THAT TUMBLE'S ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN ! BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS ! I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND ! THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK ! NO I AM THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD ! NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT ! I AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WALT IF ANYONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MISTER THOMAS ! AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY ! MASTER TAD IS RIGHT DECIDED THE GUIDE GAZING AT THE TWO BOYS APPROVINGLY ! ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MYRDALS YOKUL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY ! I PROTEST SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR ! THE VALKYRIE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD ! YOU'D HAVE BOTH OF US AT THE BOTTOM IF I LEFT IT TO YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS END ! ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS ! BE SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOOP BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAUL UP WARNED THE GUIDE ! NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND ! ARE YOU READY YES ! THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL ! HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP ! THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US ! THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE ! HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRAMPE ! CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS ! THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH ! SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYOU ! THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN ! AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS ! WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER ! LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE ! NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER ! I SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE ! IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE ! HE'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM ! VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAKNUSSEMM ! LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINYON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME ! I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM ! LIGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND ! THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY ! BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY ! THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES ! MEBBY YOU THINK HE'S HAVING SOME SORT OF A PICNIC DOWN THERE EH GLARED LIGE ! I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION ! SHALL WE HAUL UP ASKED LIGE MAKING A MEGAPHONE OF HIS HANDS YES HAUL AWAY ! THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY ! SURE THING ANSWERED THE BOY ! I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION ! NOR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFTING HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGOTS SCATTERING AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW ! THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LADDER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE !
6313-66129.422-122949 ! HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM ! EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER ! WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS ! THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS ! COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT ! WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES ! WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD ! IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED ! AND WE'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU ANNOUNCED STACY SWELLING WITH PRIDE ! HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION ! JAM EXCLAIMED CHUNKY STRETCHING HIS NECK AND EYEING THE DISH LONGINGLY ! PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION ! NOW FALL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN DIRECTED THE PROFESSOR ! HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED ! I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO ! ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING ! HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY ! EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS GOOD AND STUPID ! PRESIDENT BROWN I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES ! OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ENDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY ! I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW ! IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER ! YES THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF CAVES ! THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY ! THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT ! VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF ! BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT ! AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UP GROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY ! SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP ! NOTHING BUT NEW WHYS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL INEXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION ! AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING ! DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS ! THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS ! WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH ! THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE ! THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE ! AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON ! IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL ! A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED ! THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF ! THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE ! ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION ! IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN ! THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE ! ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM ! ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER ! GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY ! WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS ! THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN ! A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS ! GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND ! PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND ! THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH ! THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION ! THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN ! OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY ! TAD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER ! AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE ! THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND ! ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER THEE ! WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY ! BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT ! HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED ! THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN ! WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY ! PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU ! ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE ! I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE ! AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL ! TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO ! AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING ! AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS !
6313-76958.3752-4943 ! CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP ! HE HAD BEEN A CLERK IN A BANKING HOUSE AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT THOUGH BY SOME GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO HIS GUILT WERE ENTERTAINED ! EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT ! WHEN THE MUSTER BELL RANG AND THE GANG BROKE UP RUFUS DAWES ON HIS SILENT WAY TO HIS SEPARATE CELL OBSERVED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF CUSTOM IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE NEW CONVICT !

A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE ! WHAT IS HE MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE SAID THE WRETCHED MAN TO HIMSELF AS HE HUGGED HIS MISERY CLOSE ! THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT ! ABOUT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING MISTER NORTH WHO AMONGST OTHER VAGARIES NOT APPROVED OF BY HIS BISHOP HAD A HABIT OF PROWLING ABOUT THE PRISON AT UNOFFICIAL HOURS WAS ATTRACTED BY A DISPUTE AT THE DOOR OF THE DORMITORY !

OH YOU MINISTERS OF CHRIST WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING YOU SHALL BE JUDGED FOR THIS ! STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT ! LET HIM OUT CRIED NORTH AGAIN STAMPING HIS FOOT ! THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN ! THERE'S MORE TROUBLE WITH YOU BLOODY ARISTOCRATS THAN ENOUGH LIE QUIET ! IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH ! YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THAT UNHAPPY BOY HAS SUFFERED ! STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN ! IMPERTINENT YOUNG BEGGAR SAID BURGESS ! YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON ! DO HIM GOOD CURSE HIM ! LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP ! IT'S HARD FOR SUCH YOUNG UNS !

KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE ! HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE BOY FLUNG HIMSELF BENEATH THE LOG ! ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON ! HOLD ON TO ME MISS NANCY SAID THE GIANT I'M BIG ENOUGH TO CARRY DOUBLE ! GRUB PI LE GRUB PI LE ! BUT KIRKLAND KEPT STEADILY ON FOR THE RIVER ! WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN ! JUST AS HE REACHED IT HOWEVER THE FIGURE OF MISTER NORTH ROSE FROM BEHIND A PILE OF STONES !

6345-64257.6319-64726 ! WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEENIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB ! WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN ! AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE ! ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK ! WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEENIE UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL ! THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND ! SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE ! IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE ! THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY ! NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT ! SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND ! SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY ! IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS ! HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS ! BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ! ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD ! AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS ! THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE ! SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER ! SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH ! SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS ! HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE ! SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL ! BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT ! BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET ! HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP ! SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM ! HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING ! HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING ! I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU ! I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING ! THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY ! THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY ! MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY ! HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST ! THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER ! SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN ! THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT ! THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS ! THE VIOLINS AND HAUT BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE ! WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN ! HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD !
7850-111771.5338-24640 ! THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HON THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE ! CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT ! AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS ! MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT ! GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD ! EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE ! GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID ! MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN ! INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS ! WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME ! HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES ! HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS ! THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING ! MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED ! TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR ! HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION ! WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS ! THEY HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS ! HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE ! SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT !
7850-281318.6241-61946 ! SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS ! I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY ! INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE ! HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP ! AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU ! OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR ! OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME ! GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTR FJORDUNGR ! AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY ! WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN ! SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD ! THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW ! SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES ! I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR ! AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY ! SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM ! THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US ! WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE ! SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE ! I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE ! O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY ! MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF ! THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS ! HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE ! AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST ! A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY ! SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE ! LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS ! AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES ! IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET ! I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN ! I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND ! CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW ! THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM ! HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO ! TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD ! CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON ! IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS ! YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES ! BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT ! MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE ! AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES ! AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER ! HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION ! BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL ! I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER ! FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER ! ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION !
7850-73752.5536-43363 ! FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE ! REINCARNATION AND THE CONVERSE OF SPIRITS ! IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE ! THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL ! IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE ! THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS OR BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES GASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD ! THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES ! GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME ! FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS ! IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF RAW HIDE ! IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING ! AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE ! RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY ! IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH ! HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD ! AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD ! FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET ! AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES ! THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION ! IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE ! HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA ! NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURERS HAVE BECOME THE PEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD ! HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED ! THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER ! AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM ! THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES ! IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO ! ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD ! AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY ! AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY ! WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER ! FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER ! HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN ! THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD ! IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME ! AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASSINIBOINE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP ! IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA ! MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION ! IS PAPA ALONE ENQUIRED MISS TEMPLE ! THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND !
7976-105575.6345-93302 ! GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER ! SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS ! MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE ! HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS ! OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED ! YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS ! THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT ! SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING AND HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE ! NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH ! AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY ! NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME ! SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER ! ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT ! THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT ! THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD ! IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE ! WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING ! HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION ! IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT ! BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT ! FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED ! THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET ! I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING ! HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD ! HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI ! SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR ! WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO ! SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD IT IS ! THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT ! AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING ! UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY ! A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS ! ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHIMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST ! WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY ! I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND ! FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER ! GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED ! I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID ! MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE ! THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST ! I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES ! COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU ! THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS ! DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW ! A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS ! NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US ! THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS ! I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL ! THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD ! HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT ! INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS ! ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS ! ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN ! AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT ! IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME ! AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR ! FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED ! HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE ! A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR ! SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST !
7976-110124.6345-93306 ! LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS ! THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR ! EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT ! THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE ! HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU ! THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL ! WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ! AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE ! HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT ! NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE ! LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF ! THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED ! IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS ! THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES ! HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID ! LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT ! IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT ! DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU ! BUI WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER ! HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER ! HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR ! HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM ! IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING ! IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED ! WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM ! HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY ! THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY ! HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT ! SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK ! SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND ! THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE ! WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE ! IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN ! LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY ! PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER ! I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE ! THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED ! I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE ! I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM ! YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED ! YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE ! IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED ! PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER ! ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY ! WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR ! YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY ! THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR ! THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN ! THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS ! THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE ! ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH ! IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS !
8297-275156.652-130737 ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED !

WITH ENTREES SERVE CLARETS OR OTHER RED WINES SUCH AS SWISS BORDEAUX HUNGARIAN OR ITALIAN WINES ! NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY ! AUSTRIAN BURGUNDY IS ONE OF THE FINEST WINES POSSESSING RICH FLAVOR AND FINE PERFUME OTHER BURGUNDIES ARE ! SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE ! CHABLIS A WHITE BURGUNDY DRY AND OF AGREEABLE AROMA ! IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD ! CLARETS ARE VALUED FOR THEIR FLAVOR AND FOR THEIR TONIC PROPERTIES ! HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW ! GERMAN WINES ARE OF LIGHTER CHARACTER AND ARE GENERALLY TERMED RHEIN WINES ! EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM ! HOCHHEIMER A LIGHT PLEASING AND WHOLESOME WINE ! BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW ! DRY AND OF MAGNIFICENT BOUQUET ! CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND ! LACRIMA CHRISTI A STILL WINE OF EXCELLENT FLAVOR AND BOUQUET ! WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE ! SAUTERNE IS A WHITE BORDEAUX A STRONG LUSCIOUS WINE THE BEST KNOWN VARIETIES BEING ! SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW ! VINTAGE YEARS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF WINES ! HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING ! RHEIN AND MOSELLE EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE ! BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY ! CLARET EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT AND NINETEEN O FOUR !
84-121550.652-130726 ! BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES ! SAN FRANCISCO'S CARE FREE SPIRIT WAS FULLY EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE GREAT FIRE OF NINETEEN O SIX WERE COLD ! ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL ! THOMPSON OPENED A LARGE RESTAURANT IN O'FARRELL STREET JUST ABOVE FILLMORE AND FOR TWO YEARS OR MORE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS HIS PLACE BEING NOTED FOR ITS GOOD COOKING AND ITS SPLENDID SERVICE ! THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING ! ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURNED DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DEL MONTE IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER ! I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM ! HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET ! YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST ! HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS ! SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT ! THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS ! THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE ! JOHN TAIT IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT HERE HE HAVING MADE REPUTATION AS CLUB MANAGER AND THEN AS MANAGER OF THE CLIFF HOUSE ! BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY ! THE POODLE DOG HAS A HOTEL ATTACHMENT WHERE ONE MAY GET ROOMS OR FULL APARTMENTS ! THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE ! IF YOU KNOW HOW TO ORDER AND DO NOT CARE TO COUNT THE COST WHEN YOU ORDER PROBABLY THE BEST DINNER AT THESE RESTAURANTS CAN BE HAD AT EITHER BLANCO'S OR THE POODLE DOG ! BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED ! THE CUISINE IS OF THE BEST AND THE CHEFS RANK AT THE TOP OF THEIR ART ! NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN ! AT THE TWO MENTIONED ONE PAYS FOR THE SURROUNDINGS AS WELL AS FOR THE FOOD AND SOMETIMES THIS IS WORTH PAYING FOR ! NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK ! THE RESTAURANTS OF THE PRESENT DAY THAT APPROACH NEAREST THE OLD BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF PRE FIRE DAYS OF THE FRENCH CLASS ARE JACK'S IN SACRAMENTO STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY FELIX IN MONTGOMERY STREET BETWEEN CLAY AND WASHINGTON AND THE POODLE DOG BERGEZ FRANKS IN BUSH STREET BETWEEN KEARNY AND GRANT AVENUE ! THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES ! IN EITHER OF THESE RESTAURANTS YOU WILL BE SERVED WITH THE BEST THE MARKET AFFORDS COOKED THE RIGHT WAY ! AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE ! IN THIS SAME DISTRICT IS THE MINT IN COMMERCIAL STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY STREETS ! THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART ! IT HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DINE ! THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG ! IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT ! NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE ! THE FLY TRAP AND CHARLIE'S FASHION THE FIRST IN SUTTER STREET NEAR KEARNY AND THE OTHER IN MARKET NEAR SUTTER SERVE WELL COOKED FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUP SALADS AND FISH ! THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED ! OF COURSE THESE ARE NOT THE ENTIRE MENUS BUT OF ALL THE WELL PREPARED DISHES THESE ARE THEIR BEST ! THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN ! BOTH SERVE GOOD SPANISH DINNERS AT REASONABLE PRICES ! IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE ! HIS PRICES ARE MODERATE AND HIS COOKING AND VIANDS OF THE BEST AND WILL SATISFY THE MOST CRITICAL OF THE GOURMETS ! AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED ! AT THE CORNER OF MARKET AND EDDY STREETS IS THE ODEON DOWN IN A BASEMENT WITH DECORATIONS OF MOST GARISH ORDER ! AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER ! ONE CAN ALMOST IMAGINE HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE FAMOUS RATHSKELLERS OF OLD HEIDELBERG NOT AT THE SCHLOSS OF COURSE FOR HERE YOU CANNOT LOOK DOWN ON THE WEISER AS IT FLOWS BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT WINE STUBE ON THE HILL ! AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH ! BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE GOOD MUSIC MUSIC THAT HAS MELODY AND RHYTHM AND SOOTHING CADENCES GO TO THE HEIDELBERG INN AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERT WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE EVERY EVENING ! TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED ! WE FINALLY GOT HIM TO SELECT THE ONE PRIZED ABOVE ALL OTHERS AND THIS IS WHAT CHEF SCHEILER GAVE US ! TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME ! TO THE PICKLE ADD TWO LARGE ONIONS CUT IN QUARTERS TWO FRESH CARROTS AND ABOUT ONE OUNCE OF MIXED WHOLE ALLSPICE BLACK PEPPERS CLOVES AND BAY LEAVES ! DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP ! PUT IN THE OVEN AND BROWN TO A GOLDEN COLOR ! I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER ! THEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE ROASTING PAN AND PUT IT INTO A CASSEROLE AFTER SPRINKLING IT WITH TWO OUNCES OF FLOUR ! LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE ! PUT INTO THE OVEN AGAIN AND COOK FOR HALF AN HOUR BASTING FREQUENTLY WITH THE ORIGINAL BRINE ! YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH ! WHEN DONE TAKE THE MEAT OUT OF THE SAUCE ! THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE ! STRAIN THE SAUCE THROUGH A FINE COLLANDER AND ADD A FEW RAISINS A PIECE OF HONEY CAKE OR GINGER SNAPS AND THE MEAT OF ONE FRESH TOMATO ! BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT ! SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND A LITTLE SUGAR TO TASTE ! AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS ! THE HOF BRAU HOWEVER IS LESS DISTINCTIVELY GERMAN AS THE GREATER NUMBER OF ITS PATRONS ARE AMERICANS ! SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION ! THE SPECIALTY OF THE HOF BRAU IS ABALONE'S AND THEY HAVE AS A FEATURE THIS SHELL FISH COOKED IN SEVERAL WAYS ! CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT ! THEY ALSO HAVE AS THE CHEF IN CHARGE OF THE ABALONE DISHES HERBERT FORMERLY CHEF FOR ONE OF THE YACHT CLUBS OF THE COAST WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE THE ONLY PROPER RECIPE FOR MAKING ABALONE'S TENDER ! WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO ! UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE ABALONE IS TOUGH AND UNPALATABLE BUT AFTER THE DEFT MANIPULATION OF HERBERT THEY ARE TENDER AND MAKE A FINE DISH EITHER FRIED AS CHOWDER OR A LA NEWBERG ! AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM ! IN ADDITION TO ABALONE'S THE HOF BRAU MAKES A SPECIALTY OF LITTLE OREGON CRAWFISH !
8842-302196.6319-57405 ! HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POEMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITA NUOVA PROSE AND VERSE ! IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS ! THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT ! AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED ! THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD POEM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE ! THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE ! THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY ! BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND ! POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW ! NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM ! OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AND EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF A STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTILY SUPPLIED ! THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH ! AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSES OF THE POEMS WHICH I OMITTED ! BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND ! ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED ! IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED ! MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY AND USELESS ! WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED ! IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF ! GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE ! THROUGHOUT THE VITA NUOVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA ! WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PYRRHA ! A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY ! SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION ! THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VITA NUOVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE ! WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM !
8842-302201.2412-153948 ! THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST ! IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF ! WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY ! IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE ! BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE ! NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO ! AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME ! I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS ! THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS ! SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY ! AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGN'D ! I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE ! WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE ! I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET ! TO HER I WEND ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG ! THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM ! SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE ! IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED ! THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW ! IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL ! THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR ! THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED ! IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTHEARTEDNESS ! SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING ! IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM ! EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL ! IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED ! I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN ! THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER ! THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT ! THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE ! I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO !
8842-302203.1993-147964 ! AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD ! THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES ! AND SO STRONG WAS MY PHANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE ! ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN ! WHEREBY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED ! I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW ! WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION ! SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK ! AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOK'D AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY O LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT IT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH ! ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY ! AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESS'D ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING ! WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME ! THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS IN THE UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPP'D INTO ! I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE ! THESE WILDERING PHANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD ! HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM ! THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO ! BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE ! THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY PRIMAVERA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM ! FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE ! AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGH'D AND LAUGH'D AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JOAN AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARVEL INSTANTLY ! I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE ! THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE !
